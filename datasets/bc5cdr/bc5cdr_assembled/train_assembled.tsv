Naloxone reverses the antihypertensive effect of clonidine .	I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
In unanesthetized , spontaneously hypertensive rats the decrease in blood pressure and heart rate produced by intravenous clonidine , 5 to 20 micrograms / kg , was inhibited or reversed by nalozone , 0.2 to 2 mg / kg .

These findings indicate that in spontaneously hypertensive rats the effects of central alpha - adrenoceptor stimulation involve activation of opiate receptors .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As naloxone and clonidine do not appear to interact with the same receptor site , the observed functional antagonism suggests the release of an endogenous opiate by clonidine or alpha - methyldopa and the possible role of the opiate in the central control of sympathetic tone .

Lidocaine - induced cardiac asystole .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Intravenous administration of a single 50-mg bolus of lidocaine in a 67-year - old man resulted in profound depression of the activity of the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodal pacemakers .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The patient had no apparent associated conditions which might have predisposed him to the development of bradyarrhythmias ; and , thus , this probably represented a true idiosyncrasy to lidocaine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Suxamethonium infusion rate and observed fasciculations .	I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
Suxamethonium chloride ( Sch ) was administered i.v . to 36 adult males at six rates :	B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The infusion was discontinued either when there was no muscular response to tetanic stimulation of the ulnar nerve or when Sch 120 mg was exceeded .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Fasciculations in six areas of the body were scored from 0 to 3 and summated as a total fasciculation score .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The times to first fasciculation , twitch suppression and tetanus suppression were inversely related to the infusion rates .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Fasciculations in the six areas and the total fasciculation score were related directly to the rate of infusion .	I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Total fasciculation scores in the 30-mg bolus group and the 5-mg s-1 and 20-mg s-1 infusion groups were not significantly different .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Galanthamine hydrobromide , a longer acting anticholinesterase drug , in the treatment of the central effects of scopolamine ( Hyoscine ) .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O

Effects of uninephrectomy and high protein feeding on lithium - induced chronic renal failure in rats .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O
Rats with lithium - induced nephropathy were subjected to high protein ( HP ) feeding , uninephrectomy ( NX ) or a combination of these , in an attempt to induce glomerular hyperfiltration and further progression of renal failure .	O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Newborn female Wistar rats were fed a lithium - containing diet ( 50 mmol / kg ) for 8 weeks and then randomized to normal diet , HP diet ( 40 vs. 19% ) , NX or HP+NX for another 8 weeks .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Corresponding non - lithium pretreated groups were generated .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O
When comparing all lithium treated versus non - lithium - treated groups , lithium caused a reduction in glomerular filtration rate ( GFR ) without significant changes in effective renal plasma flow ( as determined by a marker secreted into the proximal tubules ) or lithium clearance .	O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Consequently , lithium pretreatment caused a fall in filtration fraction and an increase in fractional Li excretion .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Lithium also caused proteinuria and systolic hypertension in absence of glomerulosclerosis .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
HP failed to accentuante progression of renal failure and in fact tended to increase GFR and decrease plasma creatinine levels in lithium pretreated rats .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
NX+HP caused a further rise in blood pressure in Li - pretreated rats .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
The results indicate that Li - induced nephropathy , even when the GFR is only modestly reduced , is associated with proteinuria and arterial systolic hypertension .	O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
In this model of chronic renal failure the decline in GFR is not accompanied by a corresponding fall in effective renal plasma flow , which may be the functional expression of the formation of nonfiltrating atubular glomeruli .

Treatment of Crohn 's disease with fusidic acid : an antibiotic with immunosuppressive properties similar to cyclosporin .	O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Fusidic acid is an antibiotic with T - cell specific immunosuppressive effects similar to those of cyclosporin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Because of the need for the development of new treatments for Crohn 's disease , a pilot study was undertaken to estimate the pharmacodynamics and tolerability of fusidic acid treatment in chronic active , therapy - resistant patients .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Eight Crohn 's disease patients were included .	O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Fusidic acid was administered orally in a dose of 500 mg t.d.s .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Five of 8 patients ( 63% ) improved during fusidic acid treatment : 3 at two weeks and 2 after four weeks .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
There were no serious clinical side effects , but dose reduction was required in two patients because of nausea .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The results of this pilot study suggest that fusidic acid may be of benefit in selected chronic active Crohn 's disease patients in whom conventional treatment is ineffective .	O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Because there seems to exist a scientific rationale for the use of fusidic acid at the cytokine level in inflammatory bowel disease , we suggest that the role of this treatment should be further investigated .

Sulpiride - induced tardive dystonia .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Sulpiride is a selective D2-receptor antagonist with antipsychotic and antidepressant properties .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Although initially thought to be free of extrapyramidal side effects , sulpiride - induced tardive dyskinesia and parkinsonism have been reported occasionally .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
We studied a 37-year - old man who developed persistent segmental dystonia within 2 months after starting sulpiride therapy .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O

Ocular and auditory toxicity in hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
During an 18-month period of study 41 hemodialyzed patients receiving desferrioxamine ( 10 - 40 mg / kg BW/3 times weekly ) for the first time were monitored for detection of audiovisual toxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
6 patients presented clinical symptoms of visual or auditory toxicity .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Visual toxicity was of retinal origin and was characterized by a tritan - type dyschromatopsy , sometimes associated with a loss of visual acuity and pigmentary retinal deposits .

Auditory toxicity was characterized by a mid- to high - frequency neurosensorial hearing loss and the lesion was of the cochlear type .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Desferrioxamine withdrawal resulted in a complete recovery of visual function in 1 patient and partial recovery in 3 , and a complete reversal of hearing loss in 3 patients and partial recovery in 3 .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
This toxicity appeared in patients receiving the higher doses of desferrioxamine or coincided with the normalization of ferritin or aluminium serum levels .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O

Myasthenia gravis presenting as weakness after magnesium administration .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O
We studied a patient with no prior history of neuromuscular disease who became virtually quadriplegic after parenteral magnesium administration for preeclampsia .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
The serum magnesium concentration was 3.0 mEq / L , which is usually well tolerated .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The magnesium was stopped and she recovered over a few days .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
While she was weak , 2-Hz repetitive stimulation revealed a decrement without significant facilitation at rapid rates or after exercise , suggesting postsynaptic neuromuscular blockade .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O

Source of pain and primitive dysfunction in migraine : an identical site ?	O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Twenty common migraine patients received a one sided frontotemporal application of nitroglycerin ( 10 patients ) or placebo ointment ( 10 patients ) in a double blind study .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Early onset migraine attacks were induced by nitroglycerin in seven out of 10 patients versus no patient in the placebo group .	O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subsequently 20 migraine patients , who developed an early onset attack with frontotemporal nitroglycerin , received the drug in a second induction test at other body areas .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No early onset migraine was observed .	O O O I-Entity O O O
Thus the migraine - inducing effect of nitroglycerin seems to depend on direct stimulation of the habitual site of pain , suggesting that the frontotemporal region is of crucial importance in the development of a migraine crisis .

Clotiazepam - induced acute hepatitis .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
We report the case of a patient who developed acute hepatitis with extensive hepatocellular necrosis , 7 months after the onset of administration of clotiazepam , a thienodiazepine derivative .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Clotiazepam withdrawal was followed by prompt recovery .	I-Entity O O O O O O O
The administration of several benzodiazepines , chemically related to clotiazepam , did not interfere with recovery and did not induce any relapse of hepatitis .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
This observation shows that clotiazepam can induce acute hepatitis and suggests that there is no cross hepatotoxicity between clotiazepam and several benzodiazepines .	O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Arterial hypertension as a complication of prolonged ketoconazole treatment .	O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O

Injection of Captopril ( 1 mg / kg ) , an inhibitor of angiotensin converting enzyme ( ACE ) , reduced both pulmonary and renal insufficiency in this rat model .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
The contents of albumin in the lungs were not changed , indicating that Captopril did not influence the extravasation of protein .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Renal damage as reflected by an increase in serum urea and in kidney weight was prevented by Captopril .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The amount of fibrin in the kidneys was also considerably lower than in animals which received thrombin and AMCA alone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
It is suggested that the effects of Captopril on the lungs may be attributable to a vasodilatory effect due to a reduction in the circulating level of Angiotension II and an increase in prostacyclin ( secondary to an increase in bradykinin ) .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Captopril may , by the same mechanism , reduce the increase in glomerular filtration that is known to occur after an injection of thrombin , thereby diminishing the aggregation of fibrin monomers in the glomeruli , with the result that less fibrin will be deposited and thus less kidney damage will be produced .

Chronic carbamazepine treatment in the rat : efficacy , toxicity , and effect on plasma and tissue folate concentrations .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Folate depletion has often been a problem in chronic antiepileptic drug ( AED ) therapy .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Carbamazepine ( CBZ ) , a commonly used AED , has been implicated in some clinical studies .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A rat model was developed to examine the effects of chronic CBZ treatment on folate concentrations in the rat .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
In the course of developing this model , a common vehicle , propylene glycol , by itself in high doses , was found to exhibit protective properties against induced seizures and inhibited weight gain .

Formation of these plugs was probably due to extensive tumor necrosis at the level of the walls of the major uterine veins , which resulted in an open exchange of tumor plugs to the vascular spaces ; decrease in tumor tissue coherence secondary to chemotherapy may have further contributed to the formation of tumor emboli .

Coniine , an alkaloid from Conium maculatum ( poison hemlock ) , has been shown to be teratogenic in livestock .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The major teratogenic outcome is arthrogryposis , presumably due to nicotinic receptor blockade .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Warfarin - induced artery calcification is accelerated by growth and vitamin D.	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity
The present studies demonstrate that growth and vitamin D treatment enhance the extent of artery calcification in rats given sufficient doses of Warfarin to inhibit gamma - carboxylation of matrix Gla protein , a calcification inhibitor known to be expressed by smooth muscle cells and macrophages in the artery wall .

The first series of experiments examined the influence of age and growth status on artery calcification in Warfarin - treated rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O
Treatment for 2 weeks with Warfarin caused massive focal calcification of the artery media in 20-day - old rats and less extensive focal calcification in 42-day - old rats .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
In contrast , no artery calcification could be detected in 10-month - old adult rats even after 4 weeks of Warfarin treatment .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
To directly examine the importance of growth to Warfarin - induced artery calcification in animals of the same age , 20-day - old rats were fed for 2 weeks either an ad libitum diet or a 6-g / d restricted diet that maintains weight but prevents growth .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Concurrent treatment of both dietary groups with Warfarin produced massive focal calcification of the artery media in the ad libitum - fed rats but no detectable artery calcification in the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited group .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Although the explanation for the association between artery calcification and growth status can not be determined from the present study , there was a relationship between higher serum phosphate and susceptibility to artery calcification , with 30% higher levels of serum phosphate in young , ad libitum - fed rats compared with either of the groups that was resistant to Warfarin - induced artery calcification , ie , the 10-month - old rats and the restricted - diet , growth - inhibited young rats .

This observation suggests that increased susceptibility to Warfarin - induced artery calcification could be related to higher serum phosphate levels .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The second set of experiments examined the possible synergy between vitamin D and Warfarin in artery calcification .	O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
High doses of vitamin D are known to cause calcification of the artery media in as little as 3 to 4 days .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
High doses of the vitamin K antagonist Warfarin are also known to cause calcification of the artery media , but at treatment times of 2 weeks or longer yet not at 1 week .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the current study , we investigated the synergy between these 2 treatments and found that concurrent Warfarin administration dramatically increased the extent of calcification in the media of vitamin D - treated rats at 3 and 4 days .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
There was a close parallel between the effect of vitamin D dose on artery calcification and the effect of vitamin D dose on the elevation of serum calcium , which suggests that vitamin D may induce artery calcification through its effect on serum calcium .

Because Warfarin treatment had no effect on the elevation in serum calcium produced by vitamin D , the synergy between Warfarin and vitamin D is probably best explained by the hypothesis that Warfarin inhibits the activity of matrix Gla protein as a calcification inhibitor .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
High levels of matrix Gla protein are found at sites of artery calcification in rats treated with vitamin D plus Warfarin , and chemical analysis showed that the protein that accumulated was indeed not gamma - carboxylated .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
These observations indicate that although the gamma - carboxyglutamate residues of matrix Gla protein are apparently required for its function as a calcification inhibitor , they are not required for its accumulation at calcification sites .

Oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
BACKGROUND : An association between the use of oral contraceptives and the risk of myocardial infarction has been found in some , but not all , studies .	O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated this association , according to the type of progestagen included in third - generation ( i.e. , desogestrel or gestodene ) and second - generation ( i.e. , levonorgestrel ) oral contraceptives	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity
, the dose of estrogen , and the presence or absence of prothrombotic mutations METHODS : In a nationwide , population - based , case - control study , we identified and enrolled 248 women 18 through 49 years of age who had had a first myocardial infarction between 1990 and 1995 and 925 control women who had not had a myocardial infarction and who were matched for age , calendar year of the index event , and area of residence .

Subjects supplied information on oral - contraceptive use and major cardiovascular risk factors .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
An analysis for factor V Leiden and the G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene was conducted in 217 patients and 763 controls RESULTS : The odds ratio for myocardial infarction among women who used any type of combined oral contraceptive , as compared with nonusers , was 2.0 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1.5 to 2.8 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The adjusted odds ratio was 2.5 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1.5 to 4.1 ) among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives and 1.3 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.7 to 2.5 ) among those who used third - generation oral contraceptives .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Among women who used oral contraceptives , the odds ratio was 2.1 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 1.5 to 3.0 ) for those without a prothrombotic mutation and 1.9 ( 95 percent confidence interval , 0.6 to 5.5 ) for those with a mutation CONCLUSIONS : The risk of myocardial infarction was increased among women who used second - generation oral contraceptives .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
The results with respect to the use of third - generation oral contraceptives were inconclusive but suggested that the risk was lower than the risk associated with second - generation oral contraceptives .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

Effects of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbal shell or core on the cocaine - induced locomotor hyperactivity in rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
The present study was designed to examine the effect of 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the subregions of the nucleus accumbens ( the shell and the core ) on the locomotor hyperactivity induced by cocaine in rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Male Wistar rats were implanted bilaterally with cannulae into the accumbens shell or core , and then were locally injected with GR 55562 ( an antagonist of 5-HT1B receptors ) or CP 93129 ( an agonist of 5-HT1B receptors ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Given alone to any accumbal subregion , GR 55562 ( 0.1 - 10 microg / side ) or CP 93129 ( 0.1 - 10 microg / side ) did not change basal locomotor activity .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Systemic cocaine ( 10 mg / kg ) significantly increased the locomotor activity of rats .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GR 55562 ( 0.1 - 10 microg / side ) , administered intra - accumbens shell prior to cocaine , dose - dependently attenuated the psychostimulant - induced locomotor hyperactivity .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Such attenuation was not found in animals which had been injected with GR 55562 into the accumbens core .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
When injected into the accumbens shell ( but not the core ) before cocaine , CP 93129 ( 0.1 - 10 microg / side ) enhanced the locomotor response to cocaine ; the maximum effect being observed after 10 microg / side of the agonist .

The later enhancement was attenuated after intra - accumbens shell treatment with GR 55562 ( 1 microg / side ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
Our findings indicate that cocaine induced hyperlocomotion is modified by 5-HT1B receptor ligands microinjected into the accumbens shell , but not core , this modification consisting in inhibitory and facilitatory effects of the 5-HT1B receptor antagonist ( GR 55562 ) and agonist ( CP 93129 ) , respectively .

OBJECTIVE : To report 2 cases of ticlopidine - induced cholestatic hepatitis , investigate its mechanism , and compare the observed main characteristics with those of the published cases .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CASE SUMMARIES : Two patients developed prolonged cholestatic hepatitis after receiving ticlopidine following percutaneous coronary angioplasty , with complete remission during the follow - up period .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
T - cell stimulation by therapeutic concentration of ticlopidine was demonstrated in vitro in the patients , but not in healthy controls .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DISCUSSION : Cholestatic hepatitis is a rare complication of the antiplatelet agent ticlopidine ; several cases have been reported but few in the English literature .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our patients developed jaundice following treatment with ticlopidine and showed the clinical and laboratory characteristics of cholestatic hepatitis , which resolved after discontinuation of the drug .	O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Hepatitis may develop weeks after discontinuation of the drug and may run a prolonged course , but complete remission was observed in all reported cases .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An objective causality assessment revealed that the adverse drug event was probably related to the use of ticlopidine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The mechanisms of this ticlopidine - induced cholestasis are unclear .	O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Immune mechanisms may be involved in the drug 's hepatotoxicity , as suggested by the T - cell stimulation study reported here .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In experimental nephrotic syndrome , urinary sodium excretion is decreased during the early phase of the disease .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The rate - limiting constituent of collecting duct sodium transport is the epithelial sodium channel ( ENaC ) .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
We examined the abundance of ENaC subunit mRNAs and proteins in puromycin aminonucleoside ( PAN)-induced nephrotic syndrome .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity B-Entity I-Entity O
The time courses of urinary sodium excretion , plasma aldosterone concentration and proteinuria were studied in male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with a single dose of either PAN or vehicle .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
The kinetics of urinary sodium excretion and the appearance of proteinuria were comparable with those reported previously .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Sodium retention occurred on days 2 , 3 and 6 after PAN injection .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
A significant up - regulation of alphaENaC and betaENaC mRNA abundance on days 1 and 2 preceded sodium retention on days 2 and 3 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Conversely , down - regulation of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC mRNA expression on day 3 occurred in the presence of high aldosterone concentrations , and was followed by a return of sodium excretion to control values .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
The amounts of alphaENaC , betaENaC and gammaENaC proteins were not increased during PAN - induced sodium retention .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
In conclusion , ENaC mRNA expression , especially alphaENaC , is increased in the very early phase of the experimental model of PAN - induced nephrotic syndrome in rats , but appears to escape from the regulation by aldosterone after day 3 .

The aim of the present study was to investigate changes in the plasma calcitonin gene - related peptide ( CGRP ) concentration and platelet serotonin ( 5-hydroxytriptamine , 5-HT ) content during the immediate headache and the delayed genuine migraine attack provoked by nitroglycerin .

Fifteen female migraineurs ( without aura ) and eight controls participated in the study .	O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Sublingual nitroglycerin ( 0.5 mg ) was administered .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Blood was collected from the antecubital vein four times : 60 min before and after the nitroglycerin application , and 60 and 120 min after the beginning of the migraine attack ( mean 344 and 404 min ; 12 subjects ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
In those subjects who had no migraine attack ( 11 subjects ) a similar time schedule was used .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plasma CGRP concentration increased significantly ( P<0.01 ) during the migraine attack and returned to baseline after the cessation of the migraine .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
In addition , both change and peak , showed significant positive correlations with migraine headache intensity ( P<0.001 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
However , plasma CGRP concentrations failed to change during immediate headache and in the subjects with no migraine attack .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Basal CGRP concentration was significantly higher and platelet 5-HT content tended to be lower in subjects who experienced a migraine attack .	O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Platelet serotonin content decreased significantly ( P<0.01 ) after nitroglycerin in subjects with no migraine attack but no consistent change was observed in patients with migraine attack .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In conclusion , the fact that plasma CGRP concentration correlates with the timing and severity of a migraine headache suggests a direct relationship between CGRP and migraine .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
In contrast , serotonin release from platelets does not provoke migraine , it may even counteract the headache and the concomitant CGRP release in this model .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O

Behavioral effects of urotensin - II centrally administered in mice .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
Urotensin - II ( U - II ) receptors are widely distributed in the central nervous system .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Intracerebroventricular ( i.c.v . ) injection of U - II causes hypertension and bradycardia and stimulates prolactin and thyrotropin secretion .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O

injections of U - II on behavioral , metabolic , and endocrine responses in mice .	O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of graded doses of U - II ( 1 - 10,000 ng / mouse ) provoked : ( 1 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of head dips in the hole - board test ; ( 2 ) a dose - dependent reduction in the number of entries in the white chamber in the black - and - white compartment test , and in the number of entries in the central platform and open arms in the plus - maze test ; and ( 3 ) a dose - dependent increase in the duration of immobility in the forced - swimming test and tail suspension test .

Intracerebroventricular injection of U - II also caused an increase in : food intake at doses of 100 and 1,000 ng / mouse , water intake at doses of 100 - 10,000 ng / mouse , and horizontal locomotion activity at a dose of 10,000 ng / mouse .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whatever was the dose , the central administration of U - II had no effect on body temperature , nociception , apomorphine - induced penile erection and climbing behavior , and stress - induced plasma corticosterone level .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Taken together , the present study demonstrates that the central injection of U - II at doses of 1 - 10,000 ng / mouse induces anxiogenic- and depressant - like effects in mouse .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Secondary hyperalgesia shares clinical characteristics with neurogenic hyperalgesia in patients with neuropathic pain .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Abnormal brain responses to somatosensory stimuli have been found in patients with hyperalgesia as well as in normal subjects during experimental central sensitization .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The aim of this study was to assess the effects of gabapentin , a drug effective in neuropathic pain patients , on brain processing of nociceptive information in normal and central sensitization states .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) in normal volunteers , we studied the gabapentin - induced modulation of brain activity in response to nociceptive mechanical stimulation of normal skin and capsaicin - induced secondary hyperalgesia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
The dose of gabapentin was 1,800 mg per os , in a single administration .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
We found that ( i ) gabapentin reduced the activations in the bilateral operculoinsular cortex , independently of the presence of central sensitization ; ( ii ) gabapentin reduced the activation in the brainstem , only during central sensitization ; ( iii ) gabapentin suppressed stimulus - induced deactivations , only during central sensitization ; this effect was more robust than the effect on brain activation .

These findings indicate that gabapentin has a measurable antinociceptive effect and a stronger antihyperalgesic effect most evident in the brain areas undergoing deactivation , thus supporting the concept that gabapentin is more effective in modulating nociceptive transmission when central sensitization is present .

In cyclophosphamide - induced cystitis in the rat , detrusor function is impaired and the expression and effects of muscarinic receptors altered .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whether or not the neuronal transmission may be affected by cystitis was presently investigated .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Responses of urinary strip preparations from control and cyclophosphamide - pretreated rats to electrical field stimulation and to agonists were assessed in the absence and presence of muscarinic , adrenergic and purinergic receptor antagonists .

Generally , atropine reduced contractions , but in contrast to controls , it also reduced responses to low electrical field stimulation intensity ( 1 - 5 Hz ) in inflamed preparations .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In both types , purinoceptor desensitization with alpha , beta - methylene adenosine-5'-triphosphate ( alpha , beta - meATP ) caused further reductions at low frequencies ( < 10 Hz ) .

Pulmonary shunt and cardiovascular responses to CPAP during nitroprusside - induced hypotension .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
The effects of continuous positive airway pressure ( CPAP ) on cardiovascular dynamics and pulmonary shunt ( QS / QT ) were investigated in 12 dogs before and during sodium nitroprusside infusion that decreased mean arterial blood pressure 40 - 50 per cent .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Before nitroprusside infusion , 5 cm H2O CPAP significantly , P less than .05 , decreased arterial blood pressure , but did not significantly alter heart rate , cardiac output , systemic vascular resistance , or QS / QT .	O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
cm H2O CPAP before nitroprusside infusion produced a further decrease in arterial blood pressure and significantly increased heart rate and decreased cardiac output and QS / QT .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
Nitroprusside caused significant decreases in arterial blood pressure and systemic vascular resistance and increases in heart rate , but did not change cardiac output or QS / QT .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
H2O CPAP during nitroprusside did not further alter any of the above - mentioned variables .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , 10 cm H2O CPAP decreased arterial blood pressure , cardiac output , and QS / QT .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that nitroprusside infusion rates that decrease mean arterial blood pressure by 40 - 50 per cent do not change cardiac output or QS / QT .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During nitroprusside infusion low levels of CPAP do not markedly alter cardiovascular dynamics , but high levels of CPAP ( 10 cm H2O ) , while decreasing QS / QT , produce marked decreases in arterial blood pressure and cardiac output .

Pimozide did not affect the actions of L - dopa on blood pressure and heart rate but completely blocked the enhancement of reflexes .	I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Removal of the carotid sinuses caused an elevation blood pressure and heart rate and abolished the negative chronotropic effect of norepinephrine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
However , L - dopa restored the bradycardia caused by norepinephrine in addition to decreasing blood pressure and heart rate .	O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
5-HTP ( 5 mg / kg i.v . )	I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Cocaine - induced myocardial infarction : clinical observations and pathogenetic considerations .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
Clinical and experimental data published to date suggest several possible mechanisms by which cocaine may result in acute myocardial infarction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
In individuals with preexisting , high - grade coronary arterial narrowing , acute myocardial infarction may result from an increase in myocardial oxygen demand associated with cocaine - induced increase in rate - pressure product .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
In other individuals with no underlying atherosclerotic obstruction , coronary occlusion may be due to spasm , thrombus , or both .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O
With regard to spasm , the clinical findings are largely circumstantial , and the locus of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction remains speculative .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Although certain clinical and experimental findings support the hypothesis that spasm involves the epicardial , medium - size vessels , other data suggest intramural vasoconstriction .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diffuse intramural vasoconstriction is not consistent with reports of segmental , discrete infarction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The finding of cocaine - induced vasoconstriction in segments of ( noninnervated ) human umbilical artery suggests that the presence or absence of intact innervation is not sufficient to explain the discrepant data involving the possibility of alpha - mediated effects .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , the contribution of a primary , thrombotic effect of cocaine has not been excluded .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O

The average FEV1 increases during the 6-hour observation period were 18% for ipratropium and 8% for theophylline .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
The mean duration of action was 3.8 hours with ipratropium and 2.4 hours with theophylline .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
While side effects were rare , those experienced after theophylline use did involve the cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O

This was a cross - sectional study of 85 patients from a lithium clinic who received different dose schedules .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Patients were admitted to the hospital for measurement of lithium level , creatinine clearance , urine volume , and maximum osmolality .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Multiple daily doses of lithium were associated with higher urine volumes .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
The dosing schedule , duration of lithium treatment , and daily dose of lithium did not affect maximum osmolality or creatinine clearance .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
CONCLUSIONS : Urine volume can be reduced by giving lithium once daily and/or by lowering the total daily dose .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O

These studies suggest that both phenacetin and acetaminophen may contribute to the burden of ESRD , with the risk of the latter being somewhat less than that of the former .	O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This apparent difference in risk may not be due to differences in nephrotoxic potential of the drugs themselves .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
A lower relative risk would be expected for acetaminophen if the risk of both drugs in combination with other analgesics was higher than the risk of either agent alone .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , acetaminophen has been used both as a single agent and in combination with other analgesics , whereas phenacetin was available only in combinations .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
The possibility that habitual use of acetaminophen alone increases the risk of ESRD has not been clearly demonstrated , but can not be dismissed .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O

The majority of anionic sites ( 74% in diabetic and 81% in control rats ) were found within the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A minority of anionic sites were scattered throughout the lamina densa and lamina rara interna , and were significantly smaller than those in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane ( p<0.001 and p<0.01 for diabetic and control rats , respectively ) .

Diabetic rats progressively developed albuminuria reaching 40.3 ( 32.2 - 62.0 )	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
At the same time , the number of heparan sulphate anionic sites and the total anionic site surface ( number of anionic sites x mean anionic site surface ) in the lamina rara externa of the glomerular basement membrane was reduced by 19% ( p<0.021 ) and by 26% ( p<0.02 ) , respectively .

Conformationally restricted analogs of BD1008 and an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide targeting sigma1 receptors produce anti - cocaine effects in mice .	O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Cocaine 's ability to interact with sigma receptors suggests that these proteins mediate some of its behavioral effects .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , three novel sigma receptor ligands with antagonist activity were evaluated in Swiss Webster mice : BD1018 ( 3S-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane ) , BD1063 ( 1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-4-methylpiperazine ) , and LR132 ( 1R,2S-(+)-cis - N-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-2-(1-pyrrolidinyl)cyclohexylamine ) .

The three compounds vary in their affinities for sigma2 receptors and exhibit negligible affinities for dopamine , opioid , GABA(A ) and NMDA receptors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
In behavioral studies , pre - treatment of mice with BD1018 , BD1063 , or LR132 significantly attenuated cocaine - induced convulsions and lethality .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Moreover , post - treatment with LR132 prevented cocaine - induced lethality in a significant proportion of animals .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to the protection provided by the putative antagonists , the well - characterized sigma receptor agonist di - o - tolylguanidine ( DTG ) and the novel sigma receptor agonist BD1031 ( 3R-1-[2-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)ethyl]-1,4-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]nonane ) each worsened the behavioral toxicity of cocaine .

At doses where alone , they produced no significant effects on locomotion , BD1018 , BD1063 and LR132 significantly attenuated the locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
To further validate the hypothesis that the anti - cocaine effects of the novel ligands involved antagonism of sigma receptors , an antisense oligodeoxynucleotide against sigma1 receptors was also shown to significantly attenuate the convulsive and locomotor stimulatory effects of cocaine .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
Together , the data suggests that functional antagonism of sigma receptors is capable of attenuating a number of cocaine - induced behaviors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O

The potential of compounds to cause TDP was evaluated by monitoring their effects on MAPD in dog .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Four compounds known to increase QT interval and cause TDP were investigated : terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride and E4031 .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O
These data indicate that the free ED50 in plasma for terfenadine ( 1.9 nM ) , terodiline ( 76 nM ) , cisapride ( 11 nM ) and E4031 ( 1.9 nM ) closely correlate with the free concentration in man causing QT effects .

For compounds that have shown TDP in the clinic ( terfenadine , terodiline , cisapride ) there is little differentiation between the dog ED50 and the efficacious free plasma concentrations in man ( < 10-fold ) reflecting their limited safety margins .

Differential modulation by estrogen of alpha2-adrenergic and I1-imidazoline receptor - mediated hypotension in female rats .	O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O
We have recently shown that estrogen negatively modulates the hypotensive effect of clonidine ( mixed alpha2-/I1-receptor agonist ) in female rats and implicates the cardiovascular autonomic control in this interaction .

The present study investigated whether this effect of estrogen involves interaction with alpha2- and/or I1-receptors .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Changes evoked by a single intraperitoneal injection of rilmenidine ( 600 microg / kg ) or alpha - methyldopa ( 100 mg / kg ) , selective I1- and alpha2-receptor agonists , respectively , in blood pressure , hemodynamic variability , and locomotor activity were assessed in radiotelemetered sham - operated and ovariectomized ( Ovx )	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sprague - Dawley female rats with or without 12-wk estrogen replacement .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In sham - operated rats , rilmenidine or alpha - methyldopa elicited similar hypotension that lasted at least 5 h and was associated with reductions in standard deviation of mean arterial pressure .	O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SDRR was reduced only by alpha - methyldopa .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Ovx significantly enhanced the hypotensive response to alpha - methyldopa , in contrast to no effect on rilmenidine hypotension .	O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O
The enhanced alpha - methyldopa hypotension in Ovx rats was paralleled with further reduction in SDRR and a reduced locomotor activity .	O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Estrogen replacement ( 17beta - estradiol subcutaneous pellet , 14.2 microg / day , 12 wk ) of Ovx rats restored the hemodynamic and locomotor effects of alpha - methyldopa to sham - operated levels .

OBJECTIVES : To study the long - term effects of androgen treatment on atherosclerosis in postmenopausal women .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
In a population - based study in 513 naturally postmenopausal women aged 54 - 67 years , we studied the association between self - reported intramuscularly administered high - dose estrogen - testosterone therapy ( estradiol- and testosterone esters ) and aortic atherosclerosis .

Aortic atherosclerosis was diagnosed by radiographic detection of calcified deposits in the abdominal aorta , which have been shown to reflect intima atherosclerosis .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
In almost half of these women severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present ( n=11 ) , while in women without hormone use severe atherosclerosis of the aorta was present in less than 20% ( OR 3.1 ; 95% CI , 1.1 - 8.5 , adjusted for age , years since menopause , smoking , and body mass index ) .

Sirolimus is a novel immunosuppressant with potent antiproliferative actions through its ability to inhibit the raptor - containing mammalian target of rapamycin protein kinase .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Sirolimus represents a major therapeutic advance in the prevention of acute renal allograft rejection and chronic allograft nephropathy .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Its role in the therapy of glomerulonephritis , autoimmunity , cystic renal diseases and renal cancer is under investigation .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Because sirolimus does not share the vasomotor renal adverse effects exhibited by calcineurin inhibitors , it has been designated a ' non - nephrotoxic drug ' .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
However , clinical reports suggest that , under some circumstances , sirolimus is associated with proteinuria and acute renal dysfunction .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
A common risk factor appears to be presence of pre - existing chronic renal damage .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
The mechanisms of sirolimus - associated proteinuria are multifactorial and may be due to an increase in glomerular capillary pressure following calcineurin inhibitor withdrawal .	O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has also been suggested that sirolimus directly causes increased glomerular permeability / injury , but evidence for this mechanism is currently inconclusive .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The acute renal dysfunction associated with sirolimus ( such as in delayed graft function ) may be due to suppression of compensatory renal cell proliferation and survival / repair processes .	O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although these adverse effects occur in some patients , their occurrence could be minimised by knowledge of the molecular effects of sirolimus on the kidney , the use of sirolimus in appropriate patient populations , close monitoring of proteinuria and renal function , use of angiotensin - converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers if proteinuria occurs and withdrawal if needed .

METHODS AND RESULTS : To test whether clonidine elicits pharmacological effects independent of alpha2-adrenoceptors , we have generated mice with a targeted deletion of all 3 alpha2-adrenoceptor subtypes ( alpha2ABC-/- ) .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Alpha2ABC-/- mice were completely unresponsive to the analgesic and hypnotic effects of clonidine ; however , clonidine significantly lowered heart rate in alpha2ABC-/- mice by up to 150 bpm .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clonidine - induced bradycardia in conscious alpha2ABC-/- mice was 32.3% ( 10 microg / kg ) and 26.6% ( 100 microg / kg ) of the effect in wild - type mice .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A similar bradycardic effect of clonidine was observed in isolated spontaneously beating right atria from alpha2ABC - knockout and wild - type mice .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clonidine inhibited the native pacemaker current ( I(f ) ) in isolated sinoatrial node pacemaker cells and the I(f)-generating hyperpolarization - activated cyclic nucleotide - gated ( HCN ) 2 and HCN4 channels in transfected HEK293 cells .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As a consequence of blocking I(f ) , clonidine reduced the slope of the diastolic depolarization and the frequency of pacemaker potentials in sinoatrial node cells from wild - type and alpha2ABC - knockout mice .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Direct inhibition of cardiac HCN pacemaker channels contributes to the bradycardic effects of clonidine gene - targeted mice in vivo , and thus , clonidine - like drugs represent novel structures for future HCN channel inhibitors .

Schizophrenia has been initially associated with dysfunction in dopamine neurotransmission .	I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
However , the observation that antagonists of the glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor produce schizophrenic - like symptoms in humans has led to the idea of a dysfunctioning of the glutamatergic system via its NMDA receptor .

As a result , there is a growing interest in the development of pharmacological agents with potential antipsychotic properties that enhance the activity of the glutamatergic system via a modulation of the NMDA receptor .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Among them are glycine transporter-1 ( GlyT1 )	O O O I-Entity O O O O
inhibitors such as SSR103800 , which indirectly enhance NMDA receptor function by increasing the glycine ( a co - agonist for the NMDA receptor ) levels in the synapse .	O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
This study aimed at investigating the potential antipsychotic - like properties of SSR103800 , with a particular focus on models of hyperactivity , involving either drug challenge ( ie , amphetamine and MK-801 ) or transgenic mice ( ie , NMDA Nr1(neo-/- ) and DAT(-/- ) ) .

Importantly , both classical ( haloperidol ) and atypical ( olanzapine , clozapine and aripiprazole )	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O
antipsychotics were effective in all these models of hyperactivity .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

Evidence for an involvement of D1 and D2 dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced hyperactivity in rats .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Previous studies have suggested that repeated exposure of rats to the drug or to the experimental environment is necessary to observe nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
In the present study the role of habituation to the experimental environment on the stimulant effect of nicotine in rats was examined .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
In addition , the role of dopamine receptors in mediating nicotine - induced locomotor stimulation was investigated by examining the effects of selective D1 and D2 dopamine receptor antagonists on activity induced by nicotine .

Dipyridamole - thallium-201 imaging is often performed in patients unable to exercise because of peripheral vascular disease .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Many of these patients are taking pentoxifylline ( Trental ) , a methylxanthine derivative which may improve intermittent claudication .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Whether pentoxifylline inhibits dipyridamole - induced coronary hyperemia like other methylxanthines such as theophylline and should be stopped prior to dipyridamole - thallium-201 imaging is unknown .

High incidence of primary pulmonary hypertension associated with appetite suppressants in Belgium .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
Primary pulmonary hypertension is a rare , progressive and incurable disease , which has been associated with the intake of appetite suppressant drugs .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O

Hemolysis of human erythrocytes induced by tamoxifen is related to disruption of membrane structure .	I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Tamoxifen ( TAM ) , the antiestrogenic drug most widely prescribed in the chemotherapy of breast cancer , induces changes in normal discoid shape of erythrocytes and hemolytic anemia .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
This work evaluates the effects of TAM on isolated human erythrocytes , attempting to identify the underlying mechanisms on TAM - induced hemolytic anemia and the involvement of biomembranes in its cytostatic action mechanisms .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
TAM induces hemolysis of erythrocytes as a function of concentration .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The extension of hemolysis is variable with erythrocyte samples , but 12.5 microM TAM induces total hemolysis of all tested suspensions .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
Despite inducing extensive erythrocyte lysis , TAM does not shift the osmotic fragility curves of erythrocytes .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The hemolytic effect of TAM is prevented by low concentrations of alpha - tocopherol ( alpha - T ) and alpha - tocopherol acetate ( alpha - TAc ) ( inactivated functional hydroxyl ) indicating that TAM - induced hemolysis is not related to oxidative membrane damage .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
This was further evidenced by absence of oxygen consumption and hemoglobin oxidation both determined in parallel with TAM - induced hemolysis .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Furthermore , it was observed that TAM inhibits the peroxidation of human erythrocytes induced by AAPH , thus ruling out TAM - induced cell oxidative stress .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Hemolysis caused by TAM was not preceded by the leakage of K(+ ) from the cells , also excluding a colloid - osmotic type mechanism of hemolysis , according to the effects on osmotic fragility curves .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
However , TAM induces release of peripheral proteins of membrane - cytoskeleton and cytosol proteins essentially bound to band 3 .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Either alpha - T or alpha - TAc increases membrane packing and prevents TAM partition into model membranes .	O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
These effects suggest that the protection from hemolysis by tocopherols is related to a decreased TAM incorporation in condensed membranes and the structural damage of the erythrocyte membrane is consequently avoided .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , TAM - induced hemolysis results from a structural perturbation of red cell membrane , leading to changes in the framework of the erythrocyte membrane and its cytoskeleton caused by its high partition in the membrane .	O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These defects explain the abnormal erythrocyte shape and decreased mechanical stability promoted by TAM , resulting in hemolytic anemia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Additionally , since membrane leakage is a final stage of cytotoxicity , the disruption of the structural characteristics of biomembranes by TAM may contribute to the multiple mechanisms of its anticancer action .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O

After 4-week administration of L - NAME , the systolic blood pressure ( SBP ) increased by 36% .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
When activating the ( Na , K)-ATPase with its substrate ATP , no changes in Km and Vmax values were observed in NO - deficient rats .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
During activation with Na+ , the Vmax remained unchanged , however the K(Na ) increased by 50% , indicating a profound decrease in the affinity of the Na+-binding site in NO - deficient rats .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O
After recovery from hypertension , the activity of ( Na , K)-ATPase increased , due to higher affinity of the ATP - binding site , as revealed from the lowered Km value for ATP .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

It has been shown that bromocriptine - induced tachycardia , which persisted after adrenalectomy , is ( i ) mediated by central dopamine D2 receptor activation and ( ii ) reduced by 5-day isoproterenol pretreatment , supporting therefore the hypothesis that this effect is dependent on sympathetic outflow to the heart .

In isolated perfused heart preparations from isoproterenol - pretreated rats , the isoproterenol - induced maximal increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was significantly reduced , compared with saline - pretreated rats ( the EC50 of the isoproterenol - induced increase in left ventricular systolic pressure was enhanced approximately 22-fold ) .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results show that 15-day isoproterenol pretreatment not only abolished but reversed bromocriptine - induced tachycardia to bradycardia , an effect that is mainly related to further cardiac beta - adrenoceptor desensitization rather than to impairment of autonomic regulation of the heart .

Previous investigations have determined that , in response to clonidine , ultrasound production increases through the 2nd - week postpartum and decreases thereafter .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Given that sympathetic neural dominance exhibits a similar developmental pattern , and given that clonidine induces sympathetic withdrawal and bradycardia , we hypothesized that clonidine 's developmental effects on cardiac rate and ultrasound production would mirror each other .

Therefore , in the present experiment , the effects of clonidine administration ( 0.5 mg / kg ) on cardiac rate and ultrasound production were examined in 2- , 8- , 15- , and 20-day - old rats .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Age - related changes in ultrasound production corresponded with changes in cardiovascular variables , including baseline cardiac rate and clonidine - induced bradycardia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
This experiment is discussed with regard to the hypothesis that ultrasound production is the acoustic by - product of a physiological maneuver that compensates for clonidine 's detrimental effects on cardiovascular function .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Experimental design consisted of four groups : control ( vehicle alone ) , GSPE alone , drug alone and GSPE+drug .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
For the cytoprotection study , animals were orally gavaged 100 mg / Kg GSPE for 7 - 10 days followed by i.p .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O

Results indicate that GSPE preexposure prior to AAP , AMI and DOX , provided near complete protection in terms of serum chemistry changes ( ALT , BUN and CPK ) , and significantly reduced DNA fragmentation .

GSPE+drug exposed tissues exhibited minor residual damage or near total recovery .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Interestingly , all the drugs , such as , AAP , AMI and DOX induced apoptotic death in addition to necrosis in the respective organs which was very effectively blocked by GSPE .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Since AAP , AMI and DOX undergo biotransformation and are known to produce damaging radicals in vivo , the protection by GSPE may be linked to both inhibition of metabolism and/or detoxification of cytotoxic radicals .

Additionally , this may have been the first report on AMI - induced apoptotic death in the lung tissue .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Taken together , these events undoubtedly establish GSPE 's abundant bioavailability , and the power to defend multiple target organs from toxic assaults induced by structurally diverse and functionally different entities in vivo .

metamizol in acutely and chronically treated ( once a day for 12 days ) rats .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the 13th day , antinociceptive effects were assessed using a model of inflammatory nociception , pain - induced functional impairment model , and the charcoal meal test was used to evaluate the intestinal transit .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Simultaneous administration of morphine with metamizol resulted in a markedly antinociceptive potentiation and an increasing of the duration of action after a single ( 298+/-7 vs. 139+/-36 units area ( ua ) ; P<0.001 ) and repeated administration ( 280+/-17 vs. 131+/-22	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antinociceptive effect of morphine was reduced in chronically treated rats ( 39+/-10 vs. 18+/-5 au ) while the combination - induced antinociception was remained similar as an acute treatment ( 298+/-7 vs. 280+/-17 au ) .

Acute antinociceptive effects of the combination were partially prevented by 3.2 mg / kg naloxone s.c .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In independent groups , morphine inhibited the intestinal transit in 48+/-4% and 38+/-4% after acute and chronic treatment , respectively , suggesting that tolerance did not develop to the constipating effects .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The combination inhibited intestinal transit similar to that produced by morphine regardless of the time of treatment , suggesting that metamizol did not potentiate morphine - induced constipation .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
These findings show a significant interaction between morphine and metamizol in chronically treated rats , suggesting that this combination could be useful for the treatment of chronic pain .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

Amount of bleeding and hematoma size in the collagenase - induced intracerebral hemorrhage rat model .	O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
The aggravated risk on intracerebral hemorrhage ( ICH ) with drugs used for stroke patients should be estimated carefully .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
We therefore established sensitive quantification methods and provided a rat ICH model for detection of ICH deterioration .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O
In ICH intrastriatally induced by 0.014-unit , 0.070-unit , and 0.350-unit collagenase , the amount of bleeding was measured using a hemoglobin assay developed in the present study and was compared with the morphologically determined hematoma volume .

The blood amounts and hematoma volumes were significantly correlated , and the hematoma induced by 0.014-unit collagenase was adequate to detect ICH deterioration .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In ICH induction using 0.014-unit collagenase , heparin enhanced the hematoma volume 3.4-fold over that seen in control ICH animals and the bleeding 7.6-fold .	O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O
Data suggest that this sensitive hemoglobin assay is useful for ICH detection , and that a model with a small ICH induced with a low - dose collagenase should be used for evaluation of drugs that may affect ICH .

Methamphetamine - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation are not mediated by fractalkine receptor signaling .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O

Neurosci . 9 ( 2006 ) , 917 ] recently identified the microglial - specific fractalkine receptor ( CX3CR1 ) as an important mediator of MPTP - induced neurodegeneration of DA neurons .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
Because the CNS damage caused by METH and MPTP is highly selective for the DA neuronal system in mouse models of neurotoxicity , we hypothesized that the CX3CR1 plays a role in METH - induced neurotoxicity and microglial activation .

METH depleted DA , caused microglial activation , and increased body temperature in CX3CR1 knockout mice to the same extent and over the same time course seen in wild - type controls .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of METH in CX3CR1 knockout mice were not gender - dependent and did not extend beyond the striatum .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Striatal microglia expressing eGFP constitutively show morphological changes after METH that are characteristic of activation .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
This response was restricted to the striatum and contrasted sharply with unresponsive eGFP - microglia in surrounding brain areas that are not damaged by METH .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
We conclude from these studies that CX3CR1 signaling does not modulate METH neurotoxicity or microglial activation .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O

The present study was performed to elucidate the role of SGK1 in the volume retention and fibrosis during nephrotic syndrome .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
To this end , doxorubicin ( 15 mug / g body wt ) was injected intravenously into gene - targeted mice lacking SGK1 ( sgk1(-/- ) ) and their wild - type littermates ( sgk1(+/+ ) ) .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Doxorubicin treatment resulted in heavy proteinuria ( > 100 mg protein / mg crea ) in 15/44 of sgk1(+/+ ) and 15/44 of sgk1(-/- ) mice leading to severe nephrotic syndrome with ascites , lipidemia , and hypoalbuminemia in both genotypes .

Clinically significant proteinuria following the administration of sirolimus to renal transplant recipients .	O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Sirolimus is the latest immunosuppressive agent used to prevent rejection , and may have less nephrotoxicity than calcineurin inhibitor ( CNI)-based regimens .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
To date there has been little documentation of clinically significant proteinuria linked with the use of sirolimus .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
We have encountered several patients who developed substantial proteinuria associated with sirolimus use .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
In each patient , the close temporal association between the commencement of sirolimus therapy and proteinuria implicated sirolimus as the most likely etiology of the proteinuria .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
METHODS : We analyzed the clinical and laboratory information available for all 119 patients transplanted at the Washington Hospital Center between 1999 - 2003 for whom sirolimus was a component of their immunosuppressant regimen .

In these patients , the magnitude of proteinuria was assessed on morning urine samples by turbidometric measurement or random urine protein : creatinine ratios , an estimate of grams of proteinuria / day .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Laboratory results were compared between prior , during and following sirolimus use .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Twenty - eight patients ( 24% ) developed increased proteinuria from baseline during their post - transplantation course .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
In 21 patients an alternative cause of proteinuria was either obvious or insufficient data was available to be conclusive .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O

This study measured the objective and subjective neurocognitive effects of a single 10-mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone in healthy , older ( > 65 years ) , and middle - aged ( 35 to 55 years ) adults who were not suffering from chronic or significant daily pain .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Seventy - one participants completed 2 separate study days and were blind to medication condition ( placebo , 10-mg oxycodone ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Plasma oxycodone concentration peaked between 60 and 90 minutes postdose ( P < .01 ) and pupil size , an indication of physiological effects of the medication , peaked at approximately 90 to 120 minutes postdose ( P < .01 ) .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Significant declines in simple and sustained attention , working memory , and verbal memory were observed at 1 hour postdose compared to baseline for both age groups with a trend toward return to baseline by 5 hours postdose .

This study suggests that for healthy older adults who are not suffering from chronic pain , neurocognitive and pharmacodynamic changes in response to a 10-mg dose of immediate - release oxycodone are similar to those observed for middle - aged adults .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O

Progressive abstinence from cocaine was associated with worsening of all measured polysomnographic sleep outcomes .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared with placebo , modafinil decreased nighttime sleep latency and increased slow - wave sleep time in cocaine - dependent participants .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
The effect of modafinil interacted with the abstinence week and was associated with longer total sleep time and shorter REM sleep latency in the third week of abstinence .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparison of slow - wave sleep time , total sleep time , and sleep latency in cocaine - dependent and healthy participants revealed a normalizing effect of modafinil in cocaine - dependent participants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O
Modafinil was associated with increased daytime sleep latency , as measured by the Multiple Sleep Latency Test , and a nearly significant decrease in subjective daytime sleepiness .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Morning - dosed modafinil promotes nocturnal sleep , normalizes sleep architecture , and decreases daytime sleepiness in abstinent cocaine users .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O

Thymus weight was used as a marker of glucocorticoid activity , and serum urate to assess XO inhibition .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Dex increased SBP ( 110 + /-	I-Entity B-Entity I-Entity O O O O

Extrapyramidal side effects with risperidone and haloperidol at comparable D2 receptor occupancy levels .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Risperidone is an antipsychotic drug with high affinity at dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2 receptors .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O
Previous clinical studies have proposed that risperidone 's pharmacologic profile may produce improved efficacy for negative psychotic symptoms and decreased propensity for extrapyramidal side effects ; features shared by so - called ' atypical ' neuroleptics .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To determine if routine risperidone treatment is associated with a unique degree of D2 receptor occupancy and pattern of clinical effects , we used [ 123I]IBZM SPECT to determine D2 occupancy in subjects treated with routine clinical doses of risperidone ( n = 12 ) or haloperidol ( n = 7 ) .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Both risperidone and haloperidol produced D2 occupancy levels between approximately 60 and 90% at standard clinical doses .	O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no significant difference between occupancy levels obtained with haloperidol or risperidone .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O

Simvastatinezetimibe and escitalopram ( which she was taking for depression ) were discontinued , and other potential causes of hepatotoxicity were excluded .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
A repeat work - up revealed further elevations in aminotransferase levels , and liver biopsy revealed evidence of moderate - to - severe drug toxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Ezetimibe undergoes extensive glucuronidation by uridine diphosphate glucoronosyltransferases ( UGT ) in the intestine and liver and may have inhibited the glucuronidation of simvastatin hydroxy acid , resulting in increased simvastatin exposure and subsequent hepatotoxicity .

The mean doses of MZ and FL were 4.3+/-1.9 mg and 0.28+/-0.2 mg , respectively .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Mild hypoxia ( SO2<90% ) was the most common event ( 11 patients ) ; 3 patients ( 2% ) presented transient hypoxia due to upper airway obstruction by probe introduction and 8 ( 5.8% ) due to hypoxia caused by MZ use .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Transient hypotension ( SAP<90mmHg ) occurred in 1 patient ( 0.7% ) .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The multivariate analysis showed that severe MR , MP ( EF<45% ) and high doses of MZ ( > 5 mg ) were associated with events ( p<0.001 ) .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The EF was 40% , in the group with MP and 44% in the group with severe MR and it can be a factor associated with clinical events in the last group .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Recently , we found that therapy with selegiline and L - dopa was associated with selective systolic orthostatic hypotension which was abolished by withdrawal of selegiline .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O
The aims of this study were to confirm our previous findings in a separate cohort of patients and to determine the time course of the cardiovascular consequences of stopping selegiline in the expectation that this might shed light on the mechanisms by which the drug causes orthostatic hypotension .

The cardiovascular responses to standing and head - up tilt were studied repeatedly in PD patients receiving selegiline and as the drug was withdrawn .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Head - up tilt caused systolic orthostatic hypotension which was marked in six of 20 PD patients on selegiline , one of whom lost consciousness with unrecordable blood pressures .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
A lesser degree of orthostatic hypotension occurred with standing .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Orthostatic hypotension was ameliorated 4 days after withdrawal of selegiline and totally abolished 7 days after discontinuation of the drug .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Stopping selegiline also significantly reduced the supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures consistent with a previously undescribed supine pressor action .	O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
This study confirms our previous finding that selegiline in combination with L - dopa is associated with selective orthostatic hypotension .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

Systematic investigations of the human capacity to remember sensory features of experimental pain are sparse .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
In order to address long - term pain memory , nine healthy male volunteers received intradermal injections of three doses of capsaicin ( 0.05 , 1 and 20 microg , separated by 15 min breaks ) , each given three times in a balanced design across three sessions at one week intervals .

Capsaicin injection reliably induced a dose - dependent flare ( p<0.001 ) without any difference within or across sessions .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The strong burning pain decayed exponentially within a few minutes .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Subjects were able to reliably discriminate pain magnitude and duration across capsaicin doses ( both p<0.001 ) , regardless of whether first - time ratings were requested immediately , after one hour or after one day .

INTRODUCTION : Many substances that form methemoglobin ( MHb ) effectively counter cyanide ( CN ) toxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Although MHb formers are generally applied as treatments for CN poisoning , it has been proposed that a stable , long - acting MHb former could serve as a CN pretreatment .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using this rationale , the 8-aminoquinoline WR242511 , a potent long - lasting MHb former in rodents and beagle dogs , was studied in the rhesus monkey for advanced development as a potential CN pretreatment .	O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS : In this study , WR242511 was administered intravenously ( IV ) in 2 female and 4 male rhesus monkeys in doses of 3.5 and/or 7.0 mg / kg ; a single male also received WR242511 orally ( PO ) at 7.0 mg / kg .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The selected doses of WR242511 , which produced significant methemoglobinemia in beagle dogs in earlier studies conducted elsewhere , produced very little MHb ( mean < 2.0% ) in the rhesus monkey .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , transient hemoglobinuria was noted approximately 60 minutes postinjection of WR242511 ( 3.5 or 7.0 mg / kg ) , and 2 lethalities occurred ( one IV and one PO ) following the 7.0 mg / kg dose .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Anti - epileptic drugs - induced de novo absence seizures .	O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
The authors present three patients with de novo absence epilepsy after administration of carbamazepine and vigabatrin .	O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Despite the underlying diseases , the prognosis for drug - induced de novo absence seizure is good because it subsides rapidly after discontinuing the use of the offending drugs .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The gamma - aminobutyric acid - transmitted thalamocortical circuitry accounts for a major part of the underlying neurophysiology of the absence epilepsy .	O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Because drug - induced de novo absence seizure is rare , pro - absence drugs can only be considered a promoting factor .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The underlying epileptogenecity of the patients or the synergistic effects of the accompanying drugs is required to trigger the de novo absence seizure .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

Regional localization of the antagonism of amphetamine - induced hyperactivity by intracerebral calcitonin injections .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Calcitonin receptors are found in the brain , and intracerebral infusions of calcitonin can produce behavioral effects .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Among these behavioral effects are decreases in food intake and decreases in amphetamine - induced locomotor activity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O

Differential impact of immune escape mutations G145R and P120 T on the replication of lamivudine - resistant hepatitis B virus e antigen - positive and -negative strains .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
Immune escape variants of the hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) represent an emerging clinical challenge , because they can be associated with vaccine escape , HBV reactivation , and failure of diagnostic tests .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We therefore systematically analyzed the functional impact of the most prevalent immune escape variants , the sG145R and sP120 T mutants , on the viral replication efficacy and antiviral drug susceptibility of common treatment - associated mutants with resistance to lamivudine ( LAM ) and/or HBeAg negativity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Replication - competent HBV strains with sG145R or sP120 T and LAM resistance ( rtM204I or rtL180M	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O

Individual differences in renal ACE activity in healthy rats predict susceptibility to adriamycin - induced renal damage .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
In man , differences in angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) levels , related to ACE ( I / D ) genotype , are associated with renal prognosis .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , we studied the predictive effect of renal ACE activity for the severity of renal damage induced by a single injection of adriamycin in rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
METHODS : Renal ACE activity ( Hip - His - Leu cleavage by cortical homogenates ) was determined by renal biopsy in 27 adult male Wistar rats .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 1 week of recovery , proteinuria was induced by adriamycin [ 1.5 mg / kg intravenously ( i.v . )	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O

As anticipated , adriamycin elicited nephrotic range proteinuria , renal interstitial damage and mild focal glomerulosclerosis .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Baseline renal ACE positively correlated with the relative rise in proteinuria after adriamycin ( r = 0.62 , P<0.01 ) , renal interstitial alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0.49 , P<0.05 ) , interstitial macrophage influx ( r = 0.56 , P<0.05 ) , interstitial collagen III ( r = 0.53 , P<0.05 ) , glomerular alpha - smooth muscle actin ( r = 0.74 , P<0.01 ) and glomerular desmin ( r = 0.48 , P<0.05 ) .

ACE did not correlate with focal glomerulosclerosis ( r = 0.22 , NS ) .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Individual differences in renal ACE activity predict the severity of adriamycin - induced renal damage in this outbred rat strain .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O

In this study , 62 patients with confirmed initial normal renal function and treated with 2 to 5 mg / kg / day of gentamicin sulfate or tobramycin sulfate for a minimum of seven days were followed up prospectively for the development of aminoglycoside - related renal failure , defined as at least a one - third reduction in renal function .

In these 62 patients , no other causes for renal failure could be identified .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Five of 33 ( 15% ) of the tobramycin - treated patients and 16 of 29 ( 55.2% ) of the gentamicin - treated patients had renal failure .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

The aim of this study was to examine the role of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 ( mGluR5 ) in the toxic action of methamphetamine on dopaminergic neurones in rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) , administered five times , reduced the levels of dopamine and its metabolites in striatal tissue when measured 72 h after the last injection .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A selective antagonist of mGluR5 , 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine ( MPEP ; 5 mg / kg ip ) , when administered five times immediately before each methamphetamine injection reversed the above - mentioned methamphetamine effects .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
A single MPEP ( 5 mg / kg ip ) injection reduced the basal extracellular dopamine level in the striatum , as well as dopamine release stimulated either by methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc ) or by intrastriatally administered veratridine ( 100 microM ) .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Moreover , it transiently diminished the methamphetamine ( 10 mg / kg sc)-induced hyperthermia and reduced basal body temperature .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
MPEP administered into the striatum at high concentrations ( 500 microM ) increased extracellular dopamine levels , while lower concentrations ( 50 - 100 microM ) were devoid of any effect .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results of this study suggest that the blockade of mGluR5 by MPEP may protect dopaminergic neurones against methamphetamine - induced toxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Neuroprotection rendered by MPEP may be associated with the reduction of the methamphetamine - induced dopamine efflux in the striatum due to the blockade of extrastriatal mGluR5 , and with a decrease in hyperthermia .

To assess the safety of the ACE inhibitor enalapril a multicenter , randomized , prazosin - controlled trial was designed that compared the incidence and severity of symptomatic hypotension on the first day of treatment .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Trial medication was 2.5 mg enalapril or 0.5 prazosin .	O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Patients who received enalapril experienced clinically and statistically significantly less symptomatic hypotension ( 5.2% ) than the patients who received prazosin ( 12.9% ) .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
It was concluded that treatment with enalapril was well tolerated and it is , therefore , unreasonable to restrict the initiation of treatment with enalapril to inpatients .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Antagonism between interleukin 3 and erythropoietin in mice with azidothymidine - induced anemia and in bone marrow endothelial cells .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Although interleukin 3 ( IL-3 ) and erythropoietin ( EPO ) are known to act synergistically on hematopoietic cell proliferation in vitro , injection of IGF - IL-3 and EPO in AZT - treated mice resulted in a reduction of red cells and an increase of plasma EPO levels as compared to animals treated with IGF - IL-3 or EPO alone .

The nephrotoxic potential of amphotericin B ( 5 mg / kg per day intraperitoneally for 3 weeks ) has been investigated in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt - loaded rats .	O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In salt - depleted rats , amphotericin B decreased creatinine clearance linearly with time , with an 85% reduction by week 3 .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , in normal - salt rats creatinine clearance was decreased but to a lesser extent at week 2 and 3 , and in salt - loaded rats creatinine clearance did not change for 2 weeks and was decreased by 43% at week 3 .

All rats in the sodium - depleted group had histopathological evidence of patchy tubular cytoplasmic degeneration in tubules that was not observed in any normal - salt or salt - loaded rat .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Concentrations of amphotericin B in plasma were not significantly different among the three groups at any time during the study .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , at the end of 3 weeks , amphotericin B levels in the kidneys and liver were significantly higher in salt - depleted and normal - salt rats than those in salt - loaded rats , with plasma / kidney ratios of 21 , 14 , and 8 in salt - depleted , normal - salt , and salt - loaded rats , respectively .

Although there was a discrepancy between the amount of cTnI and cTnT after DOX , probably due to heterogeneity in cross - reactivities of mAbs to various cTnI and cTnT forms , it is likely that cTnT in rats after DOX indicates cell damage determined by the magnitude of injury induced and that cTnT should be a useful marker for the prediction of experimentally induced cardiotoxicity and possibly for cardioprotective experiments .

Epileptic seizures following cortical application of fibrin sealants containing tranexamic acid in rats .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
Recently , synthetic fibrinolysis inhibitors such as tranexamic acid ( tAMCA ) have been considered as substitutes for aprotinin .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
However , tAMCA has been shown to cause epileptic seizures .	O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
We wanted to study whether tAMCA retains its convulsive action if incorporated into a FS .	O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
FS containing aprotinin or different concentrations of tAMCA ( 0.5 - 47.5 mg / ml ) were applied to the pial surface of the cortex of anaesthetized rats .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FS containing tAMCA caused paroxysmal brain activity which was associated with distinct convulsive behaviours .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The degree of these seizures increased with increasing concentration of tAMCA .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
Thus , FS containing 47.5 mg / ml tAMCA evoked generalized seizures in all tested rats ( n=6 ) while the lowest concentration of tAMCA ( 0.5 mg / ml ) only evoked brief episodes of jerk - correlated convulsive potentials in 1 of 6 rats .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
INTERPRETATION : Tranexamic acid retains its convulsive action within FS .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O
Thus , use of FS containing tAMCA for surgery within or close to the CNS may pose a substantial risk to the patient .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Previous research in this laboratory has shown that a diet of intermittent excessive sugar consumption produces a state with neurochemical and behavioral similarities to drug dependency .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
The present study examined whether female rats on various regimens of sugar access would show behavioral cross - sensitization to a low dose of amphetamine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
After a 30-min baseline measure of locomotor activity ( day 0 ) , animals were maintained on a cyclic diet of 12-h deprivation followed by 12-h access to 10% sucrose solution and chow pellets ( 12 h access starting 4 h after onset of the dark period ) for 21 days .

Nine days later locomotor activity was measured in response to a single low dose of amphetamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
The animals that had experienced cyclic sucrose and chow were hyperactive in response to amphetamine compared with four control groups ( ad libitum 10% sucrose and chow followed by amphetamine injection , cyclic chow followed by amphetamine injection , ad libitum chow with amphetamine , or cyclic 10% sucrose and chow with a saline injection ) .

The hematologic effects of cefonicid and cefazedone in the dog : a potential model of cephalosporin hematotoxicity in man .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O
Cephalosporin antibiotics cause a variety of hematologic disturbances in man , the pathogeneses and hematopathology of which remain poorly characterized .	I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There is a need for a well - defined animal model in which these blood dyscrasias can be studied .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
In four subacute toxicity studies , the intravenous administration of cefonicid or cefazedone to beagle dogs caused a dose - dependent incidence of anemia , neutropenia , and thrombocytopenia after 1 - 3 months of treatment .

A nonregenerative anemia was the most compromising of the cytopenias and occurred in approximately 50% of dogs receiving 400 - 500 mg / kg cefonicid or 540 - 840 mg	O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O

Upon rechallenge with either cephalosporin , the hematologic syndrome was reproduced in most dogs tested ; cefonicid ( but not cefazedone)-treated dogs showed a substantially reduced induction period ( 15 + /-	O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
This observation , along with the rapid rate of decline in red cell mass parameters of affected dogs , suggests that a hemolytic component complicated the red cell production problem and that multiple toxicologic mechanisms contributed to the cytopenia .

The present study sought to characterize the cognitive - enhancing effects of the 5-HT(6 ) antagonist Ro4368554 ( 3-benzenesulfonyl-7-(4-methyl - piperazin-1-yl)1H - indole ) in a rat object recognition task employing a cholinergic ( scopolamine pretreatment ) and a serotonergic- ( tryptophan ( TRP ) depletion ) deficient model , and compared its pattern of action with that of the acetylcholinesterase inhibitor metrifonate .

BACKGROUND : Sirolimus ( SRL ) may supplement calcineurin inhibitors in clinical organ transplantation .	O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
These are nephrotoxic , but SRL seems to act differently displaying only minor nephrotoxic effects , although this question is still open .	O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
In a number of treatment protocols where SRL was combined with a calcineurin inhibitor indications of a synergistic nephrotoxic effect were described .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
The aim of this study was to examine further the renal function , including morphological analysis of the kidneys of male Sprague - Dawley rats treated with either cyclosporine A ( CsA ) , tacrolimus ( FK506 ) or SRL as monotherapies or in different combinations .

The morphological analysis of the kidneys included a semi - quantitative scoring system analysing the degree of striped fibrosis , subcapsular fibrosis and the number of basophilic tubules , plus an additional stereological analysis of the total grade of fibrosis in the cortex stained with Sirius Red .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
CsA , FK506 and SRL all significantly decreased the GFR .	I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O
A further deterioration was seen when CsA was combined with either FK506 or SRL , whereas the GFR remained unchanged in the group treated with FK506 plus SRL when compared with treatment with any of the single substances .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The semi - quantitative scoring was significantly worst in the group treated with CsA plus SRL ( P<0.001 compared with controls ) and the analysis of the total grade of fibrosis also showed the highest proportion in the same group and was significantly different from controls ( P<0.02 ) .

Measurements included arterial ketone body ratio ( AKBR , aceto - acetate/3-hydroxybutyrate ) and clinical hepatic function parameters .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
In group C , AKBR showed a significant decrease at 120 min ( -40% ) and at 180 min ( -49% ) after the start of hypotension and at 60 min ( -32% ) after recovery of normotension , and SGOT , SGPT , LDH and total bilirubin showed significant increases after operation .

Acute effects of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea on hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters in pilocarpine - induced seizure in rats .	O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
The present study aimed to investigate the anticonvulsant activity as well as the effects on the level of hippocampal amino acid neurotransmitters ( glutamate , aspartate , glycine and GABA ) of N-(2-propylpentanoyl)urea ( VPU ) in comparison to its parent compound , valproic acid ( VPA ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O
VPU was more potent than VPA , exhibiting the median effective dose ( ED(50 ) ) of 49 mg / kg in protecting rats against pilocarpine - induced seizure whereas the corresponding value for VPA was 322 mg / kg .	I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
In vivo microdialysis demonstrated that an intraperitoneal administration of pilocarpine induced a pronounced increment of hippocampal glutamate and aspartate whereas no significant change was observed on the level of glycine and GABA .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Pretreatment with either VPU ( 50 and 100 mg / kg ) or VPA ( 300 and 600 mg / kg ) completely abolished pilocarpine - evoked increases in extracellular glutamate and aspartate .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
In addition , a statistically significant reduction was also observed on the level of GABA and glycine but less than a drastic reduction of glutamate and aspartate level .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
Based on the finding that VPU and VPA could protect the animals against pilocarpine - induced seizure it is suggested that the reduction of inhibitory amino acid neurotransmitters was comparatively minor and offset by a pronounced reduction of glutamate and aspartate .	O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Therefore , like VPA , the finding that VPU could drastically reduce pilocarpine - induced increases in glutamate and aspartate should account , at least partly , for its anticonvulsant activity observed in pilocarpine - induced seizure in experimental animals .

End - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) after orthotopic liver transplantation ( OLTX ) using calcineurin - based immunotherapy :	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The calcineurin inhibitors cyclosporine and tacrolimus are both known to be nephrotoxic .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
Recently , however , we have had an increase of patients who are presenting after OLTX with end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O
This retrospective study examines the incidence and treatment of ESRD and chronic renal failure ( CRF ) in OLTX patients .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
Patients were divided into three groups : Controls , no CRF or ESRD , n=748 ; CRF , sustained serum creatinine > 2.5 mg / dl , n=41 ; and ESRD , n=45 .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Groups were compared for preoperative laboratory variables , diagnosis , postoperative variables , survival , type of ESRD therapy , and survival from onset of ESRD .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
At 13 years after OLTX , the incidence of severe renal dysfunction was 18.1% ( CRF 8.6% and ESRD 9.5% ) .	O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Compared with control patients , CRF and ESRD patients had higher preoperative serum creatinine levels , a greater percentage of patients with hepatorenal syndrome , higher percentage requirement for dialysis in the first 3 months postoperatively , and a higher 1-year serum creatinine .	O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Multivariate stepwise logistic regression analysis using preoperative and postoperative variables identified that an increase of serum creatinine compared with average at 1 year , 3 months , and 4 weeks postoperatively were independent risk factors for the development of CRF or ESRD with odds ratios of 2.6 , 2.2 , and 1.6 , respectively .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall survival from the time of OLTX was not significantly different among groups , but by year 13 , the survival of the patients who had ESRD was only 28.2% compared with 54.6% in the control group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients developing ESRD had a 6-year survival after onset of ESRD of 27% for the patients receiving hemodialysis versus 71.4% for the patients developing ESRD who subsequently received kidney transplants .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Patients who are more than 10 years post - OLTX have CRF and ESRD at a high rate .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O

We sought to confirm this correlation with and without adjustment for prognostic variables and to investigate outcome in subgroups with increasing levels of BP reduction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Patients with a clinical diagnosis of ischemic stroke ( within 24 hours ) were consecutively allocated to receive placebo ( n=100 ) , 1 mg / h ( low - dose )	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
nimodipine ( n=101 ) , or 2 mg / h ( high - dose ) nimodipine ( n=94 ) .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Nimodipine treatment resulted in a statistically significant reduction in systolic BP ( SBP ) and diastolic BP ( DBP ) from baseline compared with placebo during the first few days .	I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In multivariate analysis , a significant correlation between DBP reduction and worsening of the neurological score was found for the high - dose group ( beta=0.49 , P=0 .	O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

DBP , but not SBP , reduction was associated with neurological worsening after the intravenous administration of high - dose nimodipine after acute stroke .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
For low - dose nimodipine , the results were not conclusive .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Transient neurologic symptoms after spinal anesthesia : a lower incidence with prilocaine and bupivacaine than with lidocaine .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Recent evidence suggests that transient neurologic symptoms ( TNSs ) frequently follow lidocaine spinal anesthesia but are infrequent with bupivacaine .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O
However , identification of a short - acting local anesthetic to substitute for lidocaine for brief surgical procedures remains an important goal .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Prilocaine is an amide local anesthetic with a duration of action similar to that of lidocaine .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Accordingly , the present , prospective double - blind study compares prilocaine with lidocaine and bupivacaine with respect to duration of action and relative risk of TNSs .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
2% lidocaine in 7.5% glucose , 2% prilocaine in 7.5% glucose , or 0.5% bupivacaine in 7.5% glucose .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
In the evening of postoperative day 1 , patients were evaluated for TNSs by a physician unaware of the drug administered and the details of the anesthetic procedure .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nine of 30 patients receiving lidocaine experienced TNSs , 1 of 30 patients receiving prilocaine ( P = 0.03 ) had them , and none of 30 patients receiving bupivacaine had TNSs .	O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Times to ambulate and to void were similar after lidocaine and prilocaine ( 150 vs. 165 min and 238 vs. 253 min , respectively ) but prolonged after bupivacaine ( 200 and 299 min , respectively ;	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Prilocaine may be preferable to lidocaine for short surgical procedures because it has a similar duration of action but a lower incidence of TNSs .	I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The role of nicotine in smoking - related cardiovascular disease .	O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Nicotine activates the sympathetic nervous system and in this way could contribute to cardiovascular disease .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Animal studies and mechanistic studies indicate that nicotine could play a role in accelerating atherosclerosis , but evidence among humans is too inadequate to be definitive about such an effect .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Almost certainly , nicotine via its hemodynamic effects contributes to acute cardiovascular events , although current evidence suggests that the effects of nicotine are much less important than are the prothrombotic effects of cigarette smoking or the effects of carbon monoxide .

Finally , the dose response for cardiovascular events of nicotine appears to be flat , suggesting that if nicotine is involved , adverse effects might be seen with relatively low - level cigarette exposures .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Octreotide , an effective treatment for acromegaly , induces gall bladder stones in 13 - 60% of patients .	I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
Because knowledge of stone composition is essential for studies of their pathogenesis , treatment , and prevention , this was investigated by direct and indirect methods in 14 octreotide treated acromegalic patients with gall stones .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Chemical analysis of gall stones retrieved at cholecystectomy from two patients , showed that they contained 71% and 87% cholesterol by weight .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
In the remaining 12 patients , localised computed tomography of the gall bladder showed that eight had stones with maximum attenuation scores of < 100 Hounsfield units ( values of < 100 HU predict cholesterol rich , dissolvable stones ) .

Hyperkalemia associated with sulindac therapy .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Hyperkalemia has recently been recognized as a complication of nonsteroidal antiinflammatory agents ( NSAID ) such as indomethacin .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Several recent studies have stressed the renal sparing features of sulindac , owing to its lack of interference with renal prostacyclin synthesis .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
We describe 4 patients in whom hyperkalemia ranging from 6.1 to 6.9 mEq / l developed within 3 to 8 days of sulindac administration .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In all of them normal serum potassium levels reached within 2 to 4 days of stopping sulindac .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
As no other medications known to effect serum potassium had been given concomitantly , this course of events is suggestive of a cause - and - effect relationship between sulindac and hyperkalemia .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
These observations indicate that initial hopes that sulindac may not be associated with the adverse renal effects of other NSAID are probably not justified .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Seizures induced by the cocaine metabolite benzoylecgonine in rats .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O
The half - life ( t1/2 ) of cocaine is relatively short , but some of the consequences of its use , such as seizures and strokes , can occur hours after exposure .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O
This led us to hypothesize that a metabolite of cocaine may be responsible for some of those delayed sequelae .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
We evaluated the potential of the major metabolite of cocaine , benzoylecgonine ( BE ) , to cause seizures .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
Two separate equimolar doses ( 0.2 and 0.4 mumol ) of either cocaine or BE were injected ventricularly in unanesthetized juvenile rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Hypothalamic prolactin receptor messenger ribonucleic acid levels , prolactin signaling , and hyperprolactinemic inhibition of pulsatile luteinizing hormone secretion are dependent on estradiol .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Hyperprolactinemia can reduce fertility and libido .	I-Entity O O O O O O
We first tested whether chronic hyperprolactinemia inhibited two neuroendocrine parameters necessary for female fertility : pulsatile LH secretion and the estrogen - induced LH surge .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Chronic hyperprolactinemia induced by the dopamine antagonist sulpiride caused a 40% reduction LH pulse frequency in ovariectomized rats , but only in the presence of chronic low levels of estradiol .	O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Sulpiride did not affect the magnitude of a steroid - induced LH surge or the percentage of GnRH neurons activated during the surge .	I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estradiol is known to influence expression of the long form of prolactin receptors ( PRL - R ) and components of prolactin 's signaling pathway .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To test the hypothesis that estrogen increases PRL - R expression and sensitivity to prolactin , we next demonstrated that estradiol greatly augments prolactin - induced STAT5 activation .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Lastly , we measured PRL - R and suppressor of cytokine signaling ( SOCS-1 and -3 and CIS , which reflect the level of prolactin signaling ) mRNAs in response to sulpiride and estradiol .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Sulpiride induced only SOCS-1 in the medial preoptic area , where GnRH neurons are regulated , but in the arcuate nucleus and choroid plexus , PRL - R , SOCS-3 , and CIS mRNA levels were also induced .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estradiol enhanced these effects on SOCS-3 and CIS .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Interestingly , estradiol also induced PRL - R , SOCS-3 , and CIS mRNA levels independently .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data show that GnRH pulse frequency is inhibited by chronic hyperprolactinemia in a steroid - dependent manner .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O

Estrogen prevents cholesteryl ester accumulation in macrophages induced by the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Individuals with HIV can now live long lives with drug therapy that often includes protease inhibitors such as ritonavir .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Many patients , however , develop negative long - term side effects such as premature atherosclerosis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
We have previously demonstrated that ritonavir treatment increases atherosclerotic lesion formation in male mice to a greater extent than in female mice .	O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , peripheral blood monocytes isolated from ritonavir - treated females had less cholesteryl ester accumulation .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O
In the present study , we have investigated the molecular mechanisms by which female hormones influence cholesterol metabolism in macrophages in response to the HIV protease inhibitor ritonavir .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Briefly , cells were differentiated for 72 h with 100 nM PMA to obtain a macrophage - like phenotype in the presence or absence of 1 nM 17beta - estradiol ( E2 ) , 100 nM progesterone or vehicle ( 0.01% ethanol ) .

Cells were then treated with 30 ng / ml ritonavir or vehicle in the presence of aggregated LDL for 24 h. Cell extracts were harvested , and lipid or total RNA was isolated .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
E2 decreased the accumulation of cholesteryl esters in macrophages following ritonavir treatment .	I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O
Ritonavir increased the expression of the scavenger receptor , CD36 mRNA , responsible for the uptake of LDL .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , ritonavir treatment selectively increased the relative levels of PPARgamma mRNA , a transcription factor responsible for the regulation of CD36 mRNA expression .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Treatment with E2 , however , failed to prevent these increases at the mRNA level .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
E2 did , however , significantly suppress CD36 protein levels as measured by fluorescent immunocytochemistry .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This data suggests that E2 modifies the expression of CD36 at the level of protein expression in monocyte - derived macrophages resulting in reduced cholesteryl ester accumulation following ritonavir treatment .

Upregulation of brain expression of P - glycoprotein in MRP2-deficient TR(- ) rats resembles seizure - induced up - regulation of this drug efflux transporter in normal rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By using this strategy to study the involvement of MRP2 in brain access of antiepileptic drugs ( AEDs ) , we recently reported that phenytoin is a substrate for MRP2 in the BBB .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
A comparable overexpression of Pgp in the BBB was obtained after pilocarpine - induced seizures in wild - type Wistar rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Experiments with systemic administration of the Pgp substrate phenobarbital and the selective Pgp inhibitor tariquidar in TR(- ) rats substantiated that Pgp is functional and compensates for the lack of MRP2 in the BBB .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because such a compensatory mechanism most likely occurs to reduce injury to the brain from cytotoxic compounds , the present data substantiate the concept that MRP2 performs a protective role in the BBB .

Furthermore , our data suggest that TR(- ) rats are an interesting tool to study consequences of overexpression of Pgp in the BBB on access of drugs in the brain , without the need of inducing seizures or other Pgp - enhancing events for this purpose .

In this study , we investigated whether increased generation of FR during status epilepticus would be sufficient to provoke abnormalities in mtDNA and in the expression and activity of cytochrome c oxidase ( CCO ) , complex IV of the respiratory chain , in the chronic phase of the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .

METHODS : In the population based , nationwide Swedish Inpatient Register a cohort of 1065 patients with Wegener 's granulomatosis , 1969 - 95 , was identified .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Through linkage with the Swedish Cancer Register , all subjects in this cohort diagnosed with bladder cancer were identified .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
Nested within the cohort , a matched case - control study was performed to estimate the association between cyclophosphamide and bladder cancer using odds ratios ( ORs ) as relative risk .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
In the cohort the cumulative risk of bladder cancer after Wegener 's granulomatosis , and the relative prevalence of a history of bladder cancer at the time of diagnosis of Wegener 's granulomatosis , were also estimated .

The median cumulative doses of cyclophosphamide among cases ( n = 11 ) and controls ( n = 25 ) were 113 g and 25 g , respectively .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The risk of bladder cancer doubled for every 10 g increment in cyclophosphamide ( OR = 2.0 , 95% confidence interval ( CI ) 0.8 to 4.9 ) .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The absolute risk for bladder cancer in the cohort reached 10% 16 years after diagnosis of Wegener 's granulomatosis , and a history of bladder cancer was ( non - significantly ) twice as common as expected at the time of diagnosis of Wegener 's granulomatosis .

Cocaine causes memory and learning impairments in rats : involvement of nuclear factor kappa B and oxidative stress , and prevention by topiramate .	I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Different mechanisms have been suggested for cocaine toxicity including an increase in oxidative stress but the association between oxidative status in the brain and cocaine induced - behaviour is poorly understood .

Nuclear factor kappa B ( NFkappaB ) is a sensor of oxidative stress and participates in memory formation that could be involved in drug toxicity and addiction mechanisms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Therefore NFkappaB activity , oxidative stress , neuronal nitric oxide synthase ( nNOS ) activity , spatial learning and memory as well as the effect of topiramate , a previously proposed therapy for cocaine addiction , were evaluated in an experimental model of cocaine administration in rats .

NFkappaB activity was decreased in the frontal cortex of cocaine treated rats , as well as GSH concentration and glutathione peroxidase activity in the hippocampus , whereas nNOS activity in the hippocampus was increased .

Memory retrieval of experiences acquired prior to cocaine administration was impaired and negatively correlated with NFkappaB activity in the frontal cortex .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , learning of new tasks was enhanced and correlated with the increase of nNOS activity and the decrease of glutathione peroxidase .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
These results provide evidence for a possible mechanistic role of oxidative and nitrosative stress and NFkappaB in the alterations induced by cocaine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

( + /-)-PG-9 antinociception peaked 15 min after injection and then slowly diminished .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The antinociception produced by ( + /-)-PG-9 was prevented by the unselective muscarinic antagonist atropine , the M1-selective antagonists pirenzepine and dicyclomine and the acetylcholine depletor hemicholinium-3 , but not by the opioid antagonist naloxone , the gamma - aminobutyric acidB antagonist 3-aminopropyl - diethoxy - methyl - phosphinic acid , the H3 agonist R-(alpha)-methylhistamine , the D2 antagonist quinpirole , the 5-hydroxytryptamine4 antagonist 2-methoxy-4-amino-5-chlorobenzoic acid 2-(diethylamino)ethyl ester hydrochloride , the 5-hydroxytryptamin1A antagonist 1-(2-methoxyphenyl)-4-[4-(2-phthalimido)butyl]piperazine hydrobromide and the polyamines depletor reserpine .

Based on these data , it can be postulated that ( + /-)-PG-9 exerted an antinociceptive effect mediated by a central potentiation of cholinergic transmission .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
( + /-)-PG-9 ( 10 - 40 mg kg-1 i.p . ) was able to prevent amnesia induced by scopolamine ( 1 mg kg-1 i.p . ) and dicyclomine ( 2 mg kg-1 i.p . ) in the mouse passive - avoidance test .

MATERIALS AND METHODS : Testosterone and prolactin were determined by radioimmunoassay .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Every patient was screened for testosterone and 451 were screened for prolactin on the basis of low sexual desire , gynecomastia or testosterone less than 4 ng./ml .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
Prolactin results were compared with those of a previous personal cohort of 1,340 patients with erectile dysfunction and systematic prolactin determination .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
Main clinical criteria tested regarding efficiency in hormone determination were low sexual desire , small testes and gynecomastia .	O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
Endocrine therapy consisted of testosterone heptylate or human chorionic gonadotropin for hypogonadism and bromocriptine for hyperprolactinemia .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Testosterone was less than 3 ng./ml .	I-Entity O O O O O O
The prevalence of repeatedly low testosterone increased with age ( 4% before age 50 years and 9% 50 years or older ) .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two pituitary tumors were discovered after testosterone determination .	O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O
Most of the other low testosterone levels seemed to result from nonorganic hypothalamic dysfunction because of normal serum luteinizing hormone and prolactin and to have only a small role in erectile dysfunction ( definite improvement in only 16 of 44 [ 36% ] after androgen therapy , normal morning or nocturnal erections in 30% and definite vasculogenic contributions in 42% ) .

Bromocriptine was definitely effective in cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Testosterone was low in less than 50% of cases with prolactin greater than 35 ng./ml .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Low prevalences and effects of low testosterone and high prolactin in erectile dysfunction can not justify their routine determination .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
However , cost - effective screening strategies recommended so far missed 40 to 50% of cases improved with endocrine therapy and the pituitary tumors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
We now advocate that before age 50 years testosterone be determined only in cases of low sexual desire and abnormal physical examination but that it be measured in all men older than 50 years .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Reduction in caffeine toxicity by acetaminophen .	O O I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O
A patient who allegedly consumed 100 tablets of an over - the - counter analgesic containing sodium acetylsalicylate , caffeine , and acetaminophen displayed no significant CNS stimulation despite the presence of 175 micrograms of caffeine per mL of serum .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Because salicylates have been reported to augment the stimulatory effects of caffeine on the CNS , attention was focused on the possibility that the presence of acetaminophen ( 52 micrograms / mL ) reduced the CNS toxicity of caffeine .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Studies in DBA/2J mice showed that : 1 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 100 mg / kg ) increased the interval between the administration of caffeine ( 300 to 450 mg / kg IP ) and the onset of fatal convulsions by a factor of about two ; and 2 ) pretreatment with acetaminophen ( 75 mg / kg ) reduced the incidence of audiogenic seizures produced in the presence of caffeine ( 12.5 to 75 mg / kg IP ) .

The subcutaneous administration of 10 mg / kg of morphine - HC1 produced a marked increase in locomotor activity in mice .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O
The morphine - induced hyperactivity was potentiated by scopolamine and attenuated by physostigmine .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
In contrast , both methscopolamine and neostigmine , which do not penetrate the blood - brain barrier , had no effect on the hyperactivity produced by morphine .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Pretreatment of mice with alpha - methyltyrosine ( 20 mg / kg i.p .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O

OBJECTIVE : To determine the safety and efficacy of adjunctive bupropion sustained - release ( SR ) on male sexual dysfunction ( SD ) induced by a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor ( SSRI ) , as SD is a common side - effect of SSRIs and the most effective treatments have yet to be determined .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The randomized sample consisted of 234 euthymic men who were receiving some type of SSRI .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The men were randomly assigned to bupropion SR ( 150 mg twice daily , 117 ) or placebo ( twice daily , 117 ) for 12 weeks .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Efficacy was evaluated using the Clinical Global Impression - Sexual Function ( CGI - SF ; the primary outcome measure ) , the International Index of Erectile Function ( IIEF ) , Arizona Sexual Experience Scale ( ASEX ) , and Erectile Dysfunction Inventory of Treatment Satisfaction ( EDITS ) ( secondary outcome measures ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 12 weeks of treatment , the mean ( sd ) scores for CGI - SF were significantly lower , i.e. better , in patients on bupropion SR , at 2.4 ( 1.2 ) , than in the placebo group , at 3.9 ( 1.1 )	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Men who received bupropion had a significant increase in the total IIEF score ( 54.4% vs 1.2% ; P= 0.003 ) , and in the five different domains of the IIEF .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Total ASEX scores were significantly lower , i.e. better , among men who received bupropion than placebo , at 15.5 ( 4.3 ) vs 21.5 ( 4.7 ) ( P= 0.002 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The EDITS scores were 67.4 ( 10.2 ) for the bupropion and 36.3 ( 11.7 ) for the placebo group ( P= 0.001 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In linear regression analyses the CGI - SF score was not affected significantly by the duration of SD , type of SSRI used and age .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O
Bupropion is an effective treatment for male SD induced by SSRIs .	I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O

Hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is one of the major causes of chronic liver disease worldwide .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O
Cancer patients who are chronic carriers of HBV have a higher hepatic complication rate while receiving cytotoxic chemotherapy ( CT ) and this has mainly been attributed to HBV reactivation .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , cancer patients who have solid and hematological malignancies with chronic HBV infection received the antiviral agent lamivudine prior	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
and during CT compared with historical control group who did not receive lamivudine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The objectives were to assess the efficacy of lamivudine in reducing the incidence of HBV reactivation , and diminishing morbidity and mortality during CT .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The prophylactic lamivudin group consisted of 37 patients who received prophylactic lamivudine treatment .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The historical controls consisted of 50 consecutive patients who underwent CT without prophylactic lamivudine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Of our control group ( n= 50 ) , 21 patients ( 42% ) were established hepatitis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Twelve ( 24% ) of them were evaluated as severe hepatitis .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
In the prophylactic lamivudine group severe hepatitis were observed only in 1 patient ( 2.7% ) of 37 patients ( p < 0.006 ) .	O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparison of the mean ALT values revealed significantly higher mean alanine aminotransferase ( ALT ) values in the control group than the prophylactic lamivudine group ; 154:64 ( p < 0.32 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Our study suggests that prophylactic lamivudine significantly decreases the incidence of HBV reactivation and overall morbidity in cancer patients during and after immunosuppressive therapy .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Ginsenoside Rg1 restores the impairment of learning induced by chronic morphine administration in rats .	B-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O
Rg1 , as a ginsenoside extracted from Panax ginseng , could ameliorate spatial learning impairment .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Previous studies have demonstrated that Rg1 might be a useful agent for the prevention and treatment of the adverse effects of morphine .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of Rg1 on learning impairment by chronic morphine administration and the mechanism responsible for this effect .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Male rats were subcutaneously injected with morphine ( 10 mg / kg ) twice a day at 12 hour intervals for 10 days , and Rg1 ( 30 mg / kg ) was intraperitoneally injected 2 hours after the second injection of morphine once a day for 10 days .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
The results showed that rats treated with Morphine / Rg1 decreased escape latency and increased the time spent in platform quadrant and entering frequency .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By implantation of electrodes and electrophysiological recording in vivo , the results showed that Rg1 restored the long - term potentiation ( LTP ) impaired by morphine in both freely moving and anaesthetised rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The electrophysiological recording in vitro showed that Rg1 restored the LTP in slices from the rats treated with morphine , but not changed LTP in the slices from normal saline- or morphine / Rg1-treated rats ; this restoration could be inhibited by N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist MK801 .

We conclude that Rg1 may significantly improve the spatial learning capacity impaired by chonic morphine administration and restore the morphine - inhibited LTP .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O
This effect is NMDA receptor dependent .	O O O I-Entity O O O

This study was carried out to determine the effect of injection duration on bruising and pain following the administration of the subcutaneous injection of heparin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Although different methods to prevent bruising and pain following the subcutaneous injection of heparin have been widely studied and described , the effect of injection duration on the occurrence of bruising and pain is little documented .	O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O
The sample for the study consisted of 50 patients to whom subcutaneous heparin was administered .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Heparin was injected over 10 seconds on the right abdominal site and 30 seconds on the left abdominal site .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Injections areas were assessed for the presence of bruising at 48 and 72 hours after each injection .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Dimensions of the bruising on the heparin applied areas were measured using transparent millimetric measuring paper .	O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The visual analog scale ( VAS ) was used to measure pain intensity and a stop - watch was used to time the pain period .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The percentage of bruising occurrence was 64% with the injection of 10 seconds duration and 42% in the 30-second injection .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It was determined that the size of the bruising was smaller in the 30-second injection .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
