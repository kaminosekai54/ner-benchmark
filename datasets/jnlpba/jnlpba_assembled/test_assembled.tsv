High-dose growth hormone does not affect proinflammatory cytokine ( tumor necrosis factor-alpha , interleukin-6 , and interferon-gamma ) release from activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells or after minimal to moderate surgical stress .

High-dose GH therapy , with GH doses 10-20 times the normal replacement dose for GH-deficient adults , has been used as an anti-catabolic agent in a number of different patient groups .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A recent study , however , has shown an increase in mortality in critically ill patients treated with high-dose GH .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The increased mortality was associated with multiorgan failure , septic shock , and uncontrolled infection , suggesting that GH may have altered the immune response .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The GH receptor and GH are both expressed in peripheral blood mononuclear cells ( PBMCs ) ; thus , GH could act as either an endocrine or an autocrine modulator of the immune response .

We have examined the hypothesis that high-dose GH therapy may induce proinflammatory cytokines , which are implicated in septic shock .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O
To do this we measured cytokine production by PBMCs incubated in conditions that simulated high-dose GH therapy , and we measured cytokine levels in patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy who were randomized to receive either high-dose GH therapy ( 13 IU/m2 x day ) or placebo .	O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To confirm the biological activity of GH in our cell culture system we used a Stat5 functional assay .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this assay GH induced a bell-shaped curve , with a maximal response at GH levels between 100-1 , 000 ng/mL .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PBMCs from healthy volunteers were incubated with GH in doses from 1-1 , 000 ng/mL for 6-72 h under resting conditions and after activation with endotoxin and the mixed lymphocyte reaction .	B-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O
Studies were repeated with PBMCs from six individuals using a GH dose of 100 ng/mL ( the level of GH found after high-dose GH therapy ) and an endotoxin dose that gave a submaximal response ( 0.01 ng/mL ) .	O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GH had no effect on cell proliferation or the production of tumor necrosis factor-alpha ( TNFalpha ) , interleukin-6 ( IL-6 ) , or interferon-gamma ( IFNgamma ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O
In patients undergoing laparoscopic cholecystectomy there was a time-related effect of surgery on cytokine levels .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was a rise in IL-6 and a fall in TNFalpha at 24 h after surgery ; however , high-dose GH therapy had no effect on the cytokine response .	O O O O O B-protein O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We considered the possibility that endogenous GH production by PBMCs could influence the cytokine response in activated PBMCs ; however , incubation of PBMCs in the presence of the GH receptor antagonist , B2036 , had no effect on TNFalpha , IL-6 , or IFNgamma production by PBMCs in either the mixed lymphocyte reaction or when activated by endotoxin .	O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O B-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O B-protein O B-protein O O B-protein O O B-cell_type O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O
These results suggest that high-dose GH therapy does not alter the proinflammatory cytokine response to surgery or endotoxin .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein O O O O O O
The results do not exclude an effect of GH on the immune response , but they suggest that the mortality seen in critically ill patients may be due to factors other than immune modulation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Interaction between interferon consensus sequence-binding protein and COP9/signalosome subunit CSN2 ( Trip15 ) .	O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O
A possible link between interferon regulatory factor signaling and the COP9/signalosome .	O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein O O O B-protein O
Interferon consensus sequence-binding protein ( ICSBP ) is a member of the interferon regulatory factors ( IRF ) that has a pivotal role in mediating resistance to pathogenic infections in mice and in promoting the differentiation of myeloid cells .	B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O
ICSBP exerts some of its transcriptional activities via association with other factors that enable its binding to a variety of promoters containing DNA composite elements .	B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DNA O B-DNA I-DNA I-DNA O
These interactions are mediated through a specific COOH-terminal domain termed IAD ( IRF association domain ) .	O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O
To gain a broader insight of the capacity of ICSBP to interact with other factors , yeast two-hybrid screens were performed using ICSBP-IAD as a bait against a B-cell cDNA library .	O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O
Trip15 was identified as a specific interacting factor with ICSBP in yeast cells , which was also confirmed by in vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down assays and by coimmunoprecipitation studies in COS7 cells .	B-protein O O O O O O O O B-protein O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_line I-cell_line O
Trip15 was recently identified as a component of the COP9/signalosome ( CSN ) complex composed of eight evolutionary conserved subunits and thus termed CSN2 .	B-protein O O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O O B-protein O
This complex has a role in cell-signaling processes , which is manifested by its associated novel kinase activity and by the involvement of its subunits in regulating multiple cell-signaling pathways and cell-cycle progression .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We show that in vitro association of ICSBP with the CSN leads to phosphorylation of ICSBP at a unique serine residue within its IAD .	O O O O O O O B-protein O O B-protein O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O
The phosphorylated residue is essential for efficient association with IRF-1 and thus for the repressor activity of ICSBP exerted on IRF-1 .	O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O B-protein O O B-protein O
This suggests that the CSN has a role in integrating incoming signals that affect the transcriptional activity of ICSBP .	O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O
Intrathymic T cell development and selection proceeds normally in the absence of glucocorticoid receptor signaling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Glucocorticoids are believed to play a role in T cell development and selection , although their precise function is controversial .	O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O
Glucocorticoid receptor ( GR ) -deficient mice were used to directly investigate this problem .	B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O O O
GR-deficient thymocytes were resistant to dexamethasone-mediated apoptosis , confirming the absence of glucocorticoid responsiveness .	B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An absence of GR signaling had no impact on thymocyte development either in vivo or in vitro .	O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O O
T cell differentiation , including positive selection , was normal as assessed by normal development of CD4+CD8+ , alphabetaTCR+CD4+ , and alphabetaTCR+CD8+ thymocytes .	B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O
Negative selection , mediated by the superantigen staphylococcal enterotoxin B ( SEB ) , or anti-CD3/CD28 , was also normal in the absence of GR signaling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to earlier reports , these data demonstrate that GR signaling is not essential for intrathymic T cell development or selection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O
Rapid polarization of Th2 cells during induction of antigen-specific IgE antibodies in vitro .	O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein O O O
BACKGROUND : Type 2 T-helper cells ( Th2 ) are involved in the regulation of the humoral immune response against antigens and allergens and directly affect which isotype will be produced .	O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mechanism that regulates antigen-specific IgE secretion and immune deviation is still not known .	O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVES : To delineate mechanisms behind antigen-specific IgE secretion we have used in vitro immunization and focused on T-cell phenotype and the activation status of the transcription factor NFkappaB .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein O
METHODS : Peripheral blood lymphocytes ( PBMC ) from seronegative donors were immunized in vitro with a peptide consisting of both a T-cell and a B-cell epitope .	O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O B-cell_type O O
RESULTS : Antigen-specific IgE antibodies could be detected after a primary immunization , during which T-helper cells secreted type 2 cytokines .	O O O B-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O B-protein I-protein I-protein O
Specific IgE was also detected in the secondary immunization , but due to a rapid polarization from Th2 to Th1 phenotype , exogenous IL-4 was required for the specific IgE secretion .	O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O B-protein O O
Analysis of NFkappaB activation in B and T cells during primary and secondary immunization showed that NFkappaB could be detected in both B and T cells during primary immunization , but was dependent on exogenous IL-4 in the secondary immunization .	O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O
CONCLUSION : This is the first evidence of antigen-specific IgE induction in vitro using naive B cells , demonstrating the involvement of T-helper cell phenotype and NFkappaB and demonstrates the usefulness of in vitro cultures to study the effect of antigens on human immunocytes .

We also evaluated the correlation between bronchial hyperreactivity ( BHR ) and eosinophils with cytokine mRNA expression .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O
METHODS : Eight BNR ( weight range 250-350 g ) were sensitized by inhaled OA ( group I ) with a 1-week interval between and then provoked with OA 1 week later .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pulmonary function tests ( PFT ) were performed at baseline and 24 h after acetylcholine challenge .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eight weight-matched normal BNR served as controls ( group II ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
All animals were anesthetized , paralyzed with gallamine , and ventilated via tracheostomy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were given varying doses of acetylcholine ( 25 , 50 , 75 , 100 microg/kg ) injected through a jugular venous catheter .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five seconds after acetylcholine injections , PFTs were performed , including a maximal forced expiratory maneuver ( MFEM ) , airway opening pressure ( P ( ao ) ) at tidal breathing and total dynamic lung compliance ( C ( dyn ) ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bronchoalveolar lavage ( BAL ) was then performed with 20 ml normal saline divided into two doses .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thereafter , the lungs were removed and examined histologically .	O O O O O O O O O O
Total RNA was extracted from lung tissue samples and reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed using primers for mRNA of IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-10 , interferon-gamma ( IFNr ) and beta-actine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-RNA O B-RNA O B-RNA O B-RNA I-RNA I-RNA I-RNA O B-RNA O
RESULTS : Group I OA treated rats had typical airway obstruction on PFTs and airway inflammation on histological examination .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ratios of IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-10 and inducible nitric oxide synthase ( iNOS ) mRNA levels to beta-actine as measured by densitometry were significantly lower in controls than in OA-sensitized rats .

The IFNr mRNA to beta-actin ratio was significantly reduced in OA-sensitized rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Group I demonstrated a band shift when compared with group II in electromobility shift assay ( EMSA ) for NF-kB indicating increased activation of this transcription factor .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O B-protein I-protein O
CONCLUSION : Th-2 related cytokine mRNA was increased but Th-1 related cytokine mRNA was decreased in OA-sensitized BNR .	O O B-RNA I-RNA I-RNA I-RNA O O O B-RNA I-RNA I-RNA I-RNA O O O O O O
An increased level of Th-2 related cytokine mRNA correlated with decreased airflow and inflammatory changes .	O O O O B-RNA I-RNA I-RNA I-RNA O O O O O O O O

3 , 5-Bis ( trifluoromethyl ) pyrazoles : a novel class of NFAT transcription factor regulator .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A series of bis ( trifluoromethyl ) pyrazoles ( BTPs ) has been found to be a novel inhibitor of cytokine production .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Identified initially as inhibitors of IL-2 synthesis , the BTPs have been optimized in this regard and even inhibit IL-2 production with a 10-fold enhancement over cyclosporine in an ex vivo assay .	O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , the BTPs show inhibition of IL-4 , IL-5 , IL-8 , and eotaxin production .	O O O O O O O B-protein O B-protein O B-protein O O O O O
Unlike the IL-2 inhibitors , cyclosporine and FK506 , the BTPs do not directly inhibit the dephosphorylation of NFAT by calcineurin .	O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O B-protein O
A repression-derepression mechanism regulating the transcription of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in primary T cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O
BACKGROUND : Despite some controversy regarding the preferential infection and replication of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV-1 ) , it appears that primary T lymphocytes , in their quiescent state , are nonpermissive for viral expression and propagation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Massive activation of viral gene expression occurs only when the host lymphocyte is activated .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O
These observations prompted us to investigate the transcriptional regulation of HIV-1 in resting or activated T cells that were isolated from cord blood or adult peripheral blood .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O
MATERIALS AND METHODS : To this end , we employed cellular purification and phenotyping techniques , in vitro protein-DNA binding studies , functional transactivation assays using proteins isolated from cord blood or adult peripheral blood T lymphocytes , and transfection experiments in primary T cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O
RESULTS : We showed that transcription from the HIV-1 long terminal repeat is repressed in resting naive T lymphocytes ; whereas , mitogenically stimulated CD4+ cells form an activator that derepresses transcription .

Negative and positive regulation act through a repressor-activator target sequence ( RATS ) , which shares homology with the interleukin-2 ( IL-2 ) purine-rich response element , through the adjacent binding site of the nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) , and weakly , through the KB region .

CONCLUSIONS : This regulation exerted by cellular transcription factors can account for several important features of HIV-1 expression in primary CD4+ cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type I-cell_type O
Tight repression in resting naive T helper cells may be a main cause of viral latency and transcriptional activation accounts for massive viral production in activated T lymphocytes .

Involvement of lipopolysaccharide binding protein , CD14 , and Toll-like receptors in the initiation of innate immune responses by Treponema glycolipids .	O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O B-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O O O O
Culture supernatants from Treponema maltophilum associated with periodontitis in humans and Treponema brennaborense found in a bovine cattle disease accompanied with cachexia caused a dose-dependent TNF-alpha synthesis in human monocytes increasing with culture time .

This activity could be reduced significantly by blocking the CD14 -part of the LPS receptor using the My 4 mAb and by polymyxin B .	O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O B-protein I-protein O O B-protein I-protein I-protein O O B-protein I-protein O
In the murine macrophage cell line RAW 264.7 , Treponema culture supernatants induced TNF-alpha secretion in a LPS binding protein ( LBP ) -dependent fashion .

To enrich for active compounds , supernatants were extracted with butanol , while whole cells were extracted using a phenol/water method resulting in recovery of material exhibiting a similar activity profile .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An LPS-LBP binding competition assay revealed an interaction of the treponeme phenol/water extracts with LBP , while precipitation studies implied an affinity to polymyxin B and endotoxin neutralizing protein .

Macrophages obtained from C3H/HeJ mice carrying a Toll-like receptor ( TLR ) -4 mutation were stimulated with treponeme extracts for NO release to assess the role of TLRs in cell activation .

We found that phenol/water-extracts of the two strains use TLRs differently with T. brennaborense-stimulating cells in a TLR-4-dependent fashion , while T. maltophilum-mediated activation apparently involved TLR-2 .

Integration of calcineurin and MEF2 signals by the coactivator p300 during T-cell apoptosis .	O O B-protein O O O O O B-protein I-protein O O O O
T-cell antigen receptor ( TCR ) -induced thymocyte apoptosis is mediated by calcium-dependent signal transduction pathways leading to the transcriptional activation of members of the Nur77 family .	B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein I-protein O
The major calcium- and calcineurin-responsive elements in the Nur77 promoter are binding sites for myocyte enhancer factor-2 ( MEF2 ) .	O O B-DNA I-DNA I-DNA I-DNA O O B-DNA I-DNA O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O
It has been shown that nuclear factor of activated T cells ( NFAT ) interacts with MEF2D and enhances its transcriptional activity , offering a plausible mechanism of activation of MEF2D by calcineurin .	O O O O O B-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein I-protein O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O B-protein O
We report here that NFATp synergizes with MEF2D to recruit the coactivator p300 for the transcription of Nur77 .	O O O O B-protein O O B-protein O O O B-protein I-protein O O O O O O
Surprisingly , the enhancement of transcriptional activity of MEF2D by NFATp does not require its DNA-binding activity , suggesting that NFATp acts as a coactivator for MEF2D .	O O O O O O O O B-protein O B-protein O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O B-protein O
Transient co-expression of p300 , MEF2D , NFATp and constitutively active calcineurin is sufficient to recapitulate TCR signaling for the selective induction of the endogenous Nur77 gene .	O O O B-protein O B-protein O B-protein O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-DNA I-DNA O
These results implicate NFAT as an important mediator of T-cell apoptosis and suggest that NFAT is capable of integrating the calcineurin signaling pathway and other pathways through direct protein-protein interaction with other transcription factors .

Induction or suppression of a B cell-specific response to self antigen in vivo is dependent upon dendritic cell activation via the TNF-alpha receptor at the time of antigen uptake .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study we show that the retinal autoantigen , S-antigen , contains a functional TNF-alpha homologous domain which stimulates maturation and differentiation of cultured dendritic cells ( DC ) or tissue DC via the p55 TNF-alpha receptor .

Tissue DC became more dendritiform in shape , and migrated into culture supernatant .	B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O
S-antigen also stimulated accumulation of cell surface MHC class II antigen with a corresponding loss of acidic intracellular vesicles , and induced IL-1beta and IL-12 mRNA expression in cultured bone marrow-derived DC .

In addition , cultured splenic DC primed immune responses to S-antigen in vivo in the absence of other , exogenous cytokine sources .	O O O O B-cell_type I-cell_type O O O O B-protein O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O
DC pulsed with either retinal S-antigen or another retinal autoantigen , interphotoreceptor retinoid binding protein ( IRBP ) , were able to stimulate naive T cell proliferation in vitro , but only S-antigen -pulsed DC were able to induce an immune response in vivo and initiate antibody class switching .

In contrast , IRBP -pulsed DC had no detectable in vivo priming effect and IgG antibody levels remained suppressed even after immunization with IRBP in complete Freund 's adjuvant .	O O O B-protein O B-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-protein O O O O O O
These results indicate that DC from the same precursor population can either induce or suppress a B cell-specific response to self antigen in vivo , the outcome being dependent upon DC activation at the time of antigen uptake	O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-cell_type O O O O O O O
