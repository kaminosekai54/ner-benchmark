Litoreibacter albidus gen . nov . , sp . nov . and Litoreibacter janthinus sp . nov . , members of the class Alphaproteobacteria isolated from the seashore .	B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Two Gram - negative , strictly aerobic , non - motile bacteria designated strains KMM 3851 ( T ) and KMM 3842 ( T ) were respectively isolated from a marine snail specimen ( Umbonium costatum ) and from surrounding sediments collected simultaneously from the shore of the Sea of Japan .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that strains KMM 3851 ( T ) and KMM 3842 ( T ) were affiliated with the Roseobacter lineage of the class Alphaproteobacteria as a separate phylogenetic line adjacent to the members of the genus Thalassobacter .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These novel isolates shared 98 . 5 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity and 15 % DNA - DNA relatedness .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The major isoprenoid quinone of both strains was Q - 10 and polar lipids consisted of phosphatidylcholine , phosphatidylethanolamine , phosphatidylglycerol and aminophospholipids .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , strain KMM 3851 ( T ) contained two unknown lipids , whereas strain KMM 3842 ( T ) contained diphosphatidylglycerol .	O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O

The DNA G + C contents were 60 . 4 mol % ( KMM 3851 ( T ) ) and 58 . 5 mol % ( KMM 3842 ( T ) ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
Based on distinctive phenotypic characteristics , DNA - DNA hybridization data and phylogenetic distance , strains KMM 3851 ( T ) and KMM 3842 ( T ) should be classified as representatives of two novel species in a new genus , Litoreibacter gen . nov . , with the type species Litoreibacter albidus sp . nov .

Methanobacterium petrolearium sp . nov . and Methanobacterium ferruginis sp . nov . , mesophilic methanogens isolated from salty environments .	B I I I I I O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O
Two methane - producing archaea , designated Mic5c12 ( T ) and Mic6c05 ( T ) , were isolated from sludge deposited in a crude oil storage tank and a tubercle on the interior of a pipe transporting natural gas - containing brine , respectively .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The isolates were Gram - staining - variable , non - motile rods and grew only on H ( 2 ) / CO ( 2 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Strain Mic6c05 ( T ) produced methane from some alcohols without showing any growth ; strain Mic5c12 ( T ) did not utilize alcohols .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The optimum growth conditions for strain Mic5c12 ( T ) were 35 ^ 0C , pH 6 . 5 and 0 - 0 . 68 M NaCl and for strain Mic6c05 ( T ) were 40 ^ 0C , pH 6 . 0 - 7 . 5 and 0 . 34 M NaCl .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Strain Mic5c12 ( T ) was halotolerant and strain Mic6c05 ( T ) was halophilic .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that strains Mic5c12 ( T ) and Mic6c05 ( T ) belonged to the genus Methanobacterium and their closest relative was Methanobacterium subterraneum A8p ( T ) ( 97 . 3 and 97 . 9 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity , respectively ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The findings from the 16S rRNA gene sequence analyses were supported by analysis of McrA , the alpha subunit of methyl - coenzyme M reductase .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the basis of phylogenetic analyses and phenotypic characteristics , two novel species are proposed , Methanobacterium petrolearium sp . nov . and Methanobacterium ferruginis sp . nov . , with type strains Mic5c12 ( T ) ( = NBRC 105198 ( T ) = DSM 22353 ( T ) ) and Mic6c05 ( T ) ( = NBRC 105197 ( T ) = DSM 21974 ( T ) ) , respectively .

Jiangella muralis sp . nov . , from an indoor environment .	B I I I I I O O O O O O
A Gram - stain - positive , non - spore - forming actinobacterium , designated 15 - Je - 017 ( T ) , was isolated from wall material of an indoor environment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
The isolate formed a rudimentary substrate mycelium that fragmented into rod - shaped cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis , strain 15 - Je - 017 ( T ) was shown to belong to the genus Jiangella and was most closely related to Jiangella alba YIM 61503 ( T ) ( 99 . 7 % 16S rRNA gene sequence similarity ) , Jiangella alkaliphila D8 - 87 ( T ) ( 99 . 0 % ) and Jiangella gansuensis YIM 002 ( T ) ( 99 . 0 % ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
The predominant menaquinone was MK - 9 ( H ( 4 ) ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whole - cell hydrolysates contained ll - diaminopimelic acid as the diagnostic diamino acid in the cell wall and rhamnose and glucose as the main sugars .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mycolic acids were absent .	O O O O O
The polar lipid profile consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol , phosphatidylglycerol , phosphatidylinositol , phosphatidylinositol mannoside and seven unknown phospholipids .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fatty acid profile contained major amounts ( > 5 % ) of anteiso - C ( 15 : 0 ) , iso - C ( 16 : 0 ) , iso - C ( 15 : 0 ) , iso - C ( 17 : 0 ) , anteiso - C ( 17 : 0 ) and C ( 17 : 1 ) omega8c , which supported the affiliation of strain 15 - Je - 017 ( T ) to the genus Jiangella .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O
DNA - DNA relatedness and physiological and biochemical tests allowed the differentiation of strain 15 - Je - 017 ( T ) from the type strains of the three known Jiangella species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O
Strain 15 - Je - 017 ( T ) represents a novel Jiangella species , for which we propose the name Jiangella muralis sp . nov . , with type strain 15 - Je - 017 ( T ) ( = DSM 45357 ( T ) = CCM 7680 ( T ) ) .

Surveys of non - ribosomal peptide and polyketide assembly lines in fungi and prospects for their analysis in vitro and in vivo .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
With many bioactive non - ribosomal peptides and polyketides produced in fungi , studies of their biosyntheses are an active area of research .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Practical limitations of working with mega - dalton synthetases including cell lysis and protein extraction to recombinant gene and pathway expression has slowed understanding of many secondary metabolic processes relative to bacterial counterparts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent advances in accessing fungal biosynthetic machinery are beginning to change this .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we describe the successes of some studies of thiotemplate biosynthesis in fungal systems , along with very recent advances in chemical tagging and mass spectrometric strategies to selectively study biosynthetic conveyer belts in isolation , and within a few years , in endogenous fungal proteomes .

OsEDR1 negatively regulates rice bacterial resistance via activation of ethylene biosynthesis .	O O O B O O O O O O O O
Rice OsEDR1 is a sequence ortholog of Arabidopsis EDR1 .	B O O O O O O O O O
However , its molecular function is unknown .	O O O O O O O O
We show here that OsEDR1 - suppressing / knockout ( KO ) plants , which developed spontaneous lesions on the leaves , have enhanced resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv . oryzae ( Xoo ) causing bacterial blight disease .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O B O O O O O O
This resistance was associated with increased accumulation of salicylic acid ( SA ) and jasmonic acid ( JA ) , induced expression of SA - and JA - related genes and suppressed accumulation of 1 - aminocyclopropane - 1 - carboxylic acid ( ACC ) , the direct precursor of ethylene , and expression of ethylene - related genes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
OsEDR1 - KO plants also showed suppressed production of ethylene .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Knockout of OsEDR1 suppressed the ACC synthase ( ACS ) gene family , which encodes the rate - limiting enzymes of ethylene biosynthesis by catalysing the formation of ACC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The lesion phenotype and enhanced bacterial resistance of the OsEDR1 - KO plants was partly complemented by the treatment with ACC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
ACC treatment was associated with decreased SA and JA biosynthesis in OsEDR1 - KO plants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , aminoethoxyvinylglycine , the inhibitor of ethylene biosynthesis , promoted expression of SA and JA synthesis - related genes in OsEDR1 - KO plants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that ethylene is a negative signalling molecule in rice bacterial resistance .	O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
In the rice - Xoo interaction , OsEDR1 transcriptionally promotes the synthesis of ethylene that , in turn , suppresses SA - and JA - associated defence signalling .	O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Characterizing demographic variation and contributions to population growth rate in a declining population .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
1 .	O O
Understanding how demographic variation translates into variation in population growth rate ( lambda ) is central to understanding population dynamics .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such understanding ideally requires knowledge of the mean , variance and covariance among all demographic rates , allowing the potential and realized contribution of each rate to lambda to be estimated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Such studies require integrated monitoring of all demographic rates across multiple years and are consequently rare , particularly in declining populations and for species with less tractable life histories .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
2 .	O O
We used 12 years of comprehensive demographic data from a declining ring ouzel ( Turdus torquatus ) population to estimate the mean , variance and covariance in all major demographic rates and estimate potential and realized demographic contributions to lambda .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3 .	O O
Population size decreased from 39 to 13 breeding pairs ( - 67 % ) and mean lambda was 0 * 91 during 1998 - 2009 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This decrease did not reflect a substantial concurrent decrease in any single key demographic rate , but reflected varying combinations of demographic rates that consistently produced lambda & lt ; 1 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
4 .	O O
Basic prospective elasticity analysis indicated that lambda was most sensitive to adult survival , closely followed by early season reproductive success and early brood first - year survival .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast , integrated elasticity analysis , accounting for estimated demographic covariance , indicated that lambda was most sensitive to early brood first - year survival , closely followed by re - nesting rate , early season reproductive success , late - brood first - year survival and adult survival .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
5 .	O O
Retrospective decomposition of variance suggested that first - year survival contributed most to observed variation in lambda .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
6 .	O O
However , demographic comparison with other related species suggested that adult survival , but not reproductive success or post - fledging survival , averaged lower than expected throughout the 12 - year study .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
7 .	O O
These data demonstrate that multiple approaches , including comprehensive demographic and comparative analyses and due consideration of conflicting answers , may be necessary to accurately diagnose the demographic basis of population change .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hydraulic constraints limit height growth in trees at high altitude .	O O O O O O O O O O O
* Low temperatures limit the fixation of photosynthates and xylogenesis .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we hypothesized that reduced longitudinal growth in trees at high altitude is related to the lower hydraulic efficiency of the transport system .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Apical buds of Norway spruce ( Picea abies ) trees at high and low elevation were heated during 2006 and 2007 .	O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At the end of the experiment , trees were felled .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Longitudinal increments and tracheid lumen areas were measured along the stem .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apical hydraulic conductivity ( k ) was estimated from anatomical data .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Before heating , high - altitude trees showed fewer ( P = 0 . 002 ) and smaller ( P = 0 . 008 ) apical conduits , and therefore reduced k ( P = 0 . 016 ) and stem elongation ( P & lt ; 0 . 0001 ) , in comparison with trees at low elevation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 2 yr of heating , k increased at both high ( P = 0 . 014 ) and low ( P = 0 . 047 ) elevation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only high - altitude trees showed increased stem elongation , which reached the same magnitude as that of controls at low elevation ( P = 0 . 735 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Heating around the apical shoots did not appear to induce significant changes in conduit dimension along the rest of the stem .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* The total number and size of xylem elements at the stem apex are strongly constrained by low temperatures .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Trees at high altitude are therefore prevented from building up an efficient transport system , and their reduced longitudinal growth reflects strong hydraulic limitations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Physiological performance of an Alaskan shrub ( Alnus fruticosa ) in response to disease ( Valsa melanodiscus ) and water stress .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Following the decades - long warming and drying trend in Alaska , there is mounting evidence that temperature - induced drought stress is associated with disease outbreaks in the boreal forest .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent evidence of this trend is an outbreak of Cytospora canker disease ( fungal pathogen Valsa melanodiscus ( anamorph = Cytospora umbrina ) ) on Alnus species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* For Alnus fruticosa , we examined the effects of water stress on disease predisposition , and the effects of disease and water stress on host physiology .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In two trials , we conducted a full - factorial experiment that crossed two levels of water stress with three types of inoculum ( two isolates of V . melanodiscus , one control isolate ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Water stress was not required for disease predisposition .	O O O O O O O O O O
However , the effects of water stress and disease on host physiology were greatest near the peak phenological stage of the host and during hot , dry conditions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During this time , water stress and disease reduced light - saturated photosynthesis ( - 30 % ) , light saturation point ( - 60 % ) and stomatal conductance ( - 40 % ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Our results depended on the timing of water stress and disease in relation to host phenology and the environment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These factors should not be overlooked in attempts to generalize predictions about the role of temperature - induced drought stress in this pathosystem .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The novel marine gliding zooflagellate genus Mantamonas ( Mantamonadida ord . n . : Apusozoa ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mantamonas is a novel genus of marine gliding zooflagellates probably related to apusomonad and planomonad Apusozoa .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using phase and differential interference contrast microscopy we describe the type species Mantamonas plastica sp . n . from coastal sediment in Cumbria , England .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O
Cells are - 5mum long , - 5mum wide , asymmetric , flattened , biciliate , and somewhat plastic .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The posterior cilium , on which they glide smoothly over the substratum , is long and highly acronematic .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The much thinner , shorter , and almost immobile anterior cilium points forward to the cell ' s left .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These morphological and behavioural traits suggest that Mantamonas is a member of the protozoan phylum Apusozoa .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analyses of 18S and 28S rRNA gene sequences of Mantamonas plastica and a second genetically very different marine species from coastal sediment in Tanzania show Mantamonas as a robustly monophyletic clade , that is very divergent from all other eukaryotes .	O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
18S rRNA trees mostly place Mantamonas within unikonts ( opisthokonts , Apusozoa , and Amoebozoa ) but its precise position varies with phylogenetic algorithm and / or taxon and nucleotide position sampling ; it may group equally weakly as sister to Planomonadida , Apusomonadida or Breviata .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
On 28S rRNA and joint 18 / 28S rRNA phylogenies ( including 11 other newly obtained apusozoan / amoebozoan 28S rRNA sequences ) it consistently strongly groups with Apusomonadida ( Apusozoa ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Scaling of swim speed in breath - hold divers .	O O O O O O O O O O
Breath - hold divers are widely assumed to descend and ascend at the speed that minimizes energy expenditure per distance travelled ( the cost of transport ( COT ) ) to maximize foraging duration at depth .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , measuring COT with captive animals is difficult , and empirical support for this hypothesis is sparse .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We examined the scaling relationship of swim speed in free - ranging diving birds , mammals and turtles ( 37 species ; mass range , 0 * 5 - 90 , 000 kg ) with phylogenetically informed statistical methods and derived the theoretical prediction for the allometric exponent under the COT hypothesis by constructing a biomechanical model .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Swim speed significantly increased with mass , despite considerable variations around the scaling line .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The allometric exponent ( 0 * 09 ) was statistically consistent with the theoretical prediction ( 0 * 05 ) of the COT hypothesis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our finding suggests a previously unrecognized advantage of size in divers : larger animals swim faster and thus could travel longer distance , search larger volume of water for prey and exploit a greater range of depths during a given dive duration .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , as predicted from the model , endotherms ( birds and mammals ) swam faster than ectotherms ( turtles ) for their size , suggesting that metabolic power production limits swim speed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Among endotherms , birds swam faster than mammals , which cannot be explained by the model .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Reynolds numbers of small birds ( & lt ; 2 kg ) were close to the lower limit of turbulent flow ( - 3 x 10 ( 5 ) ) , and they swam fast possibly to avoid the increased drag associated with flow transition .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stable isotope labelling and zinc distribution in grains studied by laser ablation ICP - MS in an ear culture system reveals zinc transport barriers during grain filling in wheat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Zinc ( Zn ) deficiency has been recognized as a potential risk for human health in many developing regions where staple food with low micronutrient density represents a major proportion of the diet .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The success of strategies to increase Zn content in the edible part of crops requires better understanding of Zn transport to , and distribution within , the grains .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The transfer of Zn from the growth medium to wheat ( Triticum aestivum ) grains in an ear culture system was investigated by using the stable Zn isotope ( 70 ) Zn , and the spatial distribution of Zn within the grains was studied by laser ablation - inductively coupled plasma - mass spectrometry ( LA - ICP - MS ) .	O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Zinc was readily transported in the stem up to the rachis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
More Zn accumulated in the stem when higher amounts of Zn were supplied to the medium .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Once Zn was transported into the grain , Zn accumulated particularly in the crease vascular tissue .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The gradient of ( 70 ) Zn concentration between crease vascular tissue , aleurone layer and endosperm demonstrates that Zn is distributed within grain through the crease phloem .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that two barriers of Zn transport into wheat grains may exist : between the stem tissue rachis and the grain , and the maternal and filial tissues in the grain .	O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Differential expression of odorant receptor genes involved in the sexual isolation of two Heliothis moths .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moth sexual communication systems are highly diverse , but the mechanisms underlying their evolutionary diversification remain unclear .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , genes coding for odorant receptors ( ORs ) OR6 , OR14 , OR15 and OR16 have been genetically associated with species - specific male response to female pheromone blends in Heliothis virescens ( Hv ) and Heliothis subflexa ( Hs ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B O O B I O B O O
Quantitative real - time PCR analysis indicates that expression of HvOR6 , HsOR6 , HvOR14 , HsOR14 , HvOR15 and HsOR15 is male biased , which supports the hypothesis that they have a role in mediating female sex pheromone detection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The genes HvOR14 , HvOR15 and HvOR16 are expressed at higher levels than their corresponding orthologues HsOR14 , HsOR15 and HsOR16 in male antennae , while HvOR6 and HsOR6 transcripts are equally abundant in male antennae .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The lack of higher expression of any of the receptor genes in H . subflexa antennae suggests that interspecific sequence differences , rather than gene regulation differences , underly the species - specific male response to pheromone components .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cryptogein , a fungal elicitor , remodels the phenylpropanoid metabolism of tobacco cell suspension cultures in a calcium - dependent manner .	O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Plant cells use calcium - based signalling pathways to transduce biotic and / or abiotic stimuli into adaptive responses .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , little is known about the coupling between calcium signalling , transcriptional regulation and the downstream biochemical processes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To understand these relationships better , we challenged tobacco BY - 2 cells with cryptogein and evaluated how calcium transients ( monitored through the calcium sensor aequorin ) impact ( 1 ) transcript levels of phenylpropanoid genes ( assessed by RT - qPCR ) ; and ( 2 ) derived - phenolic compounds ( analysed by mass spectrometry ) .	O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most genes of the phenylpropanoid pathway were up - regulated by cryptogein and cell wall - bound phenolic compounds accumulated ( mainly 5 - hydroxyferulic acid ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The accumulation of both transcripts and phenolics was calcium - dependent .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The transcriptional regulation of phenylpropanoid genes was correlated in a non - linear manner with stimulus intensity and with components of the cryptogein - induced calcium signature .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , calmodulin inhibitors increased the sensitivity of cells to low concentrations of cryptogein .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results led us to propose a model of coupling between the cryptogein signal , calcium signalling and the transcriptional response , exerting control of transcription through the coordinated action of two decoding modules exerting opposite effects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rapid detection of drug - resistant mutations in hepatitis B virus by the PCR - Invader assay .	O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Early detection of resistant mutations of hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) is important for patients on nucleos ( t ) ide analog therapy .	O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An assay based on the PCR - Invader technology was developed to detect resistant mutations with high sensitivity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The assay specifically detects mutations at codons 180 , 181 , 184 , 202 , 204 , and 250 of the HBV polymerase reverse transcriptase domain .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O
These mutations result in resistance to lamivudine and entecavir .	O O O O O O O O O O
In mixtures of plasmids containing wild - type and resistant mutants , fold - over - zero values for resistant mutations were detected in 2 % of the total .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Seventy - five serum samples from patients , whose treatment had been switched from lamivudine to entecavir , were examined by the PCR - Invader assay and direct sequencing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The PCR - Invader assay detected all resistant mutations that were detected by direct sequencing and even detected the presence of mutants that direct sequencing could not .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cloning sequencing confirmed those mutations found by the PCR - Invader assay and not by direct sequencing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The PCR - Invader assay is a useful tool for the early detection of drug - resistant mutations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Separating parental environment from seed size effects on next generation growth and development in Arabidopsis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Plant growth and development is profoundly influenced by environmental conditions that laboratory experimentation typically attempts to control .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , growth conditions are not uniform between or even within laboratories and the extent to which these differences influence plant growth and development is unknown .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Experiments with wild - type Arabidopsis thaliana were designed to quantify the influences of parental environment and seed size on growth and development in the next generation .	O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A single lot of seed was planted in six environmental chambers and grown to maturity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The seed produced was mechanically sieved into small and large size classes then grown in a common environment and subjected to a set of assays spanning the life cycle .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Analysis of variance demonstrated that seed size effects were particularly significant early in development , affecting primary root growth and gravitropism , but also flowering time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Parental environment affected progeny germination time , flowering and weight of seed the progeny produced .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In some cases , the parental environment affected the magnitude of ( interacted with ) the observed seed size effects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data indicate that life history circumstances of the parental generation can affect growth and development throughout the life cycle of the next generation to an extent that should be considered when performing genetic studies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first vitellogenin receptor from a Lepidopteran insect : molecular characterization , expression patterns and RNA interference analysis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The vitellogenin receptor ( VgR ) belongs to the low - density lipoprotein receptor ( LDLR ) superfamily , and is an important carrier for the uptake of vitellogenin ( Vg ) into developing oocytes of all oviparous species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The first full - length message for a VgR from a Lepidopteran insect was cloned and sequenced from the ovary of Spodoptera litura Fabricius ( GenBank accession no . GU983858 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
The coding region consisted of 5370 bp flanked by a 49 bp 5 ' - untranslated region ( UTR ) and a 177 bp 3 ' - UTR , which encoded a 1798 - residue protein with a predicted molecular weight ( MW ) of 201 . 69 kDa .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
S . litura VgR ( SlVgR ) comprised two ligand binding sites with four LDLR class A repeats in the first domain and seven in the second domain , an epidermal growth factor - like domain containing an LDLR class B repeat and a YWXD motif , a transmembrane domain and a cytoplasmic domain .	B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A phylogenetic relationship placed SlVgR as a separate group from the other insects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
SlVgR messenger RNA ( mRNA ) was specifically expressed in the ovarian tissues .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The developmental expression patterns showed that VgR mRNA was first transcribed in 6 ( th ) day female pupae and the maximum level of VgR mRNA appeared in 36 - h - old adults .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Immunoblot analysis detected an ovary - specific VgR protein with a MW of - 200 kDa , whose development profiles were consistent with VgR mRNA expression patterns .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RNA inteference ( RNAi ) specifically disrupted the VgR gene by injection of 3 or 5 mug VgR double - stranded RNA per insect in 4 ( th ) or 6 ( th ) day pupae .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
RNAi of SlVgR led to a phenotype characterized by high Vg accumulation in the haemolymph , low Vg deposition in the ovary and the failure of insect spawning .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results mean that VgR is critical for binding Vg and transporting it into the oocytes of the insect ovary , thus playing an important role in insect reproduction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Simian immunodeficiency virus from the sooty mangabey and rhesus macaque is modified with O - linked carbohydrate .	B I I O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O
Although stretches of serine and threonine are sometimes sites for O - linked carbohydrate attachment , specific sequence and structural determinants for O - linked attachment remain ill defined .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The gp120 envelope protein of SIVmac239 contains a serine - threonine - rich stretch of amino acids at positions 128 to 139 .	O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that lectin protein from jackfruit seed ( jacalin ) , which binds to non - and monosialylated core 1 O - linked carbohydrate , potently inhibited the replication of SIVmac239 .	O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Selection of a jacalin - resistant SIVmac239 variant population resulted in virus with specific substitutions within amino acids 128 to 139 .	O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cloned simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) variants with substitutions in the 128 - to - 139 region had infectivities equivalent to , or within 1 log unit of , that of SIVmac239 and were resistant to the inhibitory effects of jacalin .	O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Characterization of the SIVmac239 gp120 O - linked glycome showed the presence of core 1 and core 2 O - linked carbohydrate ; a 128 - to - 139 - substituted variant gp120 from jacalin - resistant SIV lacked O - linked carbohydrate .	O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Unlike that of SIVmac239 , the replication of HIV - 1 strain NL4 - 3 was resistant to inhibition by jacalin .	O O O B O O O O B I I I I I I O O O O O O O
Purified gp120s from four SIVmac and SIVsm strains bound jacalin strongly in an enzyme - linked immunosorbent assay , while nine different HIV - 1 gp120s , two SIVcpz gp120s , and 128 - to - 139 - substituted SIVmac239 gp120 did not bind jacalin .	O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
The ability or inability to bind jacalin thus correlated with the presence of the serine - threonine - rich stretch in the SIVmac and SIVsm gp120s and the absence of such stretches in the SIVcpz and HIV - 1 gp120s .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O O O B O B I I O O
Consistent with sequence predictions , two HIV - 2 gp120s bound jacalin , while one did not .	O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
These data demonstrate the presence of non - and monosialylated core 1 O - linked carbohydrate on the gp120s of SIVmac and SIVsm and the lack of these modifications on HIV - 1 and SIVcpz gp120s .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B O O O O O O O B I I O B O O
Varicella - zoster virus glycoprotein E is a critical determinant of virulence in the SCID mouse - human model of neuropathogenesis .	B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Varicella - zoster virus ( VZV ) is a neurotropic alphaherpesvirus .	B I I I O B O O O O O O
VZV infection of human dorsal root ganglion ( DRG ) xenografts in immunodeficient mice models the infection of sensory ganglia .	B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We examined DRG infection with recombinant VZV ( recombinant Oka [ rOka ] ) and the following gE mutants : gEDelta27 - 90 , gEDeltaCys , gE - AYRV , and gE - SSTT .	O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
gEDelta27 - 90 , which lacks the gE domain that interacts with a putative receptor insulin - degrading enzyme ( IDE ) , replicated as extensively as rOka , producing infectious virions and significant cytopathic effects within 14 days of inoculation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since neural cells express IDE , the gE / IDE interaction was dispensable for VZV neurotropism .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
In contrast , gEDeltaCys , which lacks gE / gI heterodimer formation , was significantly impaired at early times postinfection ; viral genome copy numbers increased slowly , and infectious virus production was not detected until day 28 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Delayed replication was associated with impaired cell - cell spread in ganglia , similar to the phenotype of a gI deletion mutant ( rOkaDeltagI ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , at later time points , infection of satellite cells and other supportive nonneuronal cells resulted in extensive DRG tissue damage and cell loss such that cytopathic changes observed at day 70 were more severe than those for rOka - infected DRG .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The replication of gE - AYRV , which is impaired for trans - Golgi network ( TGN ) localization , and the replication of gE - SSTT , which contains mutations in an acidic cluster , were equivalent to that of rOka , causing significant cytopathic effects and infectious virus production by day 14 ; genome copy numbers were equivalent to those of rOka .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These experiments suggest that the gE interaction with cellular IDE , gE targeting to TGN sites of virion envelopment , and phosphorylation at SSTT are dispensable for VZV DRG infection , whereas the gE / gI interaction is critical for VZV neurovirulence .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antiviral effects of a transgenic RNA - dependent RNA polymerase .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Transgenic expression of the RNA - dependent RNA polymerase 3D ( pol ) inhibited infection of Theiler ' s murine encephalitis virus ( TMEV ) , a picornavirus from which it was derived .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we infected 3D ( pol ) transgenic mice with another picornavirus , as well as an alphaherpesvirus and a rhabdovirus .	O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
3D ( pol ) transgenic FVB mice had significantly lower viral loads and survived longer after infection with all three types of viruses than nontransgenic FVB mice .	O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
Viral inhibition among three different types of virus by transgenic 3D ( pol ) suggests that the mechanism of action is not the direct interference with picornaviral 3D ( pol ) but instead may be the changing of host cells to an antiviral state before or after viral infection occurs , as basal interferon levels were higher in 3D ( pol ) transgenic mice before infection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Further study of this mechanism may open new possibilities for future antiviral therapy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Parasitoid developmental mortality in the field : patterns , causes and consequences for sex ratio and virginity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sex ratio theory predicts that developmental mortality can affect sex ratio optima under Local Mate Competition and also lead to ' virgin ' broods containing only females with no sibling - mating opportunities on maturity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Estimates of developmental mortality and its sex ratio effects have been laboratory based , and both models and laboratory studies have treated mortality as a phenomenon without identifying its biological causes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We contribute a large set of field data on Metaphycus luteolus Timberlake ( Hymenoptera : Encyrtidae ) , an endoparasitoid of soft scale insects ( Hemiptera : Coccidae ) , which has sex allocation conditional on host quality and female - biased brood sex ratios .	O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Developmental mortality within broods can be both assessed and attributed to distinct causes , including encapsulation by the host and larval - larval competition .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thirty per cent of M . luteolus offspring die during development with 65 % of this mortality because of encapsulation and 28 % because of larval competition .	O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The distributions of mortality overall and for each cause of mortality separately were overdispersed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The probability of an individual being encapsulated increased with clutch size , while the probability of being killed by a brood mate declined with increasing clutch size and with increasing per capita availability of resources .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sexual compositions of broods at emergence were influenced by both the degree and the type of mortality operating .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At higher levels of mortality , single sex broods were more common and sex ratios were less precise .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall , virginity was more prevalent than predicted and was more greatly affected by the occurrence of competition than by other sources of mortality , almost certainly because competition tended to eliminate males .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reproductive and developmental biology of M . luteolus appears to be influenced by a complex interplay of maternal clutch size and sex allocation strategies , offspring - offspring developmental interactions , host defence mechanisms and postemergence mating behaviour .	O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite the great sophistication of sex ratio theory , it has not yet evolved to the point where it is capable of considering all of these influences simultaneously .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The degree of mycoheterotrophic carbon gain in green , variegated and vegetative albino individuals of Cephalanthera damasonium is related to leaf chlorophyll concentrations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
* Achlorophyllous variants of some forest orchids are known to reach almost the same size as their green forms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These vegetative albino forms cover their entire carbon ( C ) demand through fungi that simultaneously form ectomycorrhizae with trees , while green variants partially draw on C from photosynthesis and C from fungal hosts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we investigate whether the amount of C derived from either source is proportional to leaf chlorophyll concentration .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The discovery of two Cephalanthera damasonium populations with variegated leaves enabled a continuous bridging of leaf chlorophyll concentrations between green and albino forms .	O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Leaves of 27 green , variegated and albino individuals of C . damasonium were compared for chlorophyll concentrations , C sources ( as characterized by ( 13 ) C abundances ) and total C and nitrogen ( N ) concentrations .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* We found a linear relationship between leaf chlorophyll concentrations and the proportional reliance on fungi as a C source .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , we show that the shift in C gain through mycoheterotrophic means significantly changes leaf total C and N concentrations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
* Our results document that partial mycoheterotrophy in C . damasonium is not a static nutritional mode but a flexible mechanism related inter alia to leaf chlorophyll concentrations .	O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The change in proportional reliance on fungi as a C source affects leaf chemical composition .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Assembly of the type II secretion system : identification of ExeA residues critical for peptidoglycan binding and secretin multimerization .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Aeromonas hydrophila secretes a number of protein toxins across the outer membrane via the type II secretion system ( T2SS ) .	B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Assembly of the secretion channel ExeD secretin into the outer membrane is dependent on the peptidoglycan binding domain of ExeA .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , the peptidoglycan binding domain PF01471 family members were divided into a prokaryotic group and a eukaryotic group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
By comparison of their sequence conservation profiles and their representative crystal structures , we found the prokaryotic members to have a highly conserved pocket ( s ) that is not present in the eukaryotic members .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Substitution mutations of nine amino acids of the pocket were constructed in ExeA .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five of the substitution derivatives showed greatly decreased lipase secretion , accompanied by defects in secretin assembly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , using in vivo cross - linking and in vitro cosedimentation assays , we showed that these mutations decreased ExeA - peptidoglycan interactions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that the highly conserved pocket in ExeA is the binding site for its peptidoglycan ligand and identify residues critical for this binding .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Translational control of the abundance of cytoplasmic poly ( A ) binding protein in human cytomegalovirus - infected cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Irrespective of their effects on ongoing host protein synthesis , productive replication of the representative alphaherpesvirus herpes simplex virus type 1 , the representative gammaherpesvirus Kaposi ' s sarcoma herpesvirus , and the representative betaherpesvirus human cytomegalovirus [ HCMV ] stimulates the assembly of the multisubunit , cap - binding translation factor eIF4F .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O B I I I I O O O O O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , only HCMV replication is associated with an increased abundance of eIF4F core components ( eIF4E , eIF4G , eIF4A ) and the eIF4F - associated factor poly ( A ) binding protein ( PABP ) .	O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we demonstrate that the increase in translation factor concentration was readily detected in an asynchronous population of HCMV - infected primary human fibroblasts , abolished by prior UV inactivation of virus , and genetically dependent upon viral immediate - early genes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Strikingly , while increased mRNA steady - state levels accompanied the rise in eIF4E and eIF4G protein levels , the overall abundance of PABP mRNA , together with the half - life of the polypeptide it encodes , remained relatively unchanged by HCMV infection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Instead , HCMV - induced PABP accumulation resulted from new protein synthesis and was sensitive to the mTORC1 - selective inhibitor rapamycin , which interferes with phosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate p70 S6K and the translational repressor 4E - BP1 .

While virus - induced PABP accumulation did not require p70 S6K , it was inhibited by the expression of a dominant - acting 4E - BP1 variant unable to be inactivated by mTORC1 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Finally , unlike the situation in alpha - or gammaherpesvirus - infected cells , where PABP is redistributed to nuclei , PABP accumulated in the cytoplasm of HCMV - infected cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Thus , cytoplasmic PABP accumulation is translationally controlled in HCMV - infected cells via a mechanism requiring mTORC1 - mediated inhibition of the cellular 4E - BP1 translational repressor .	O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A new model of Epstein - Barr virus infection reveals an important role for earlylytic viral protein expression in the development of lymphomas .	O O O O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Epstein - Barr virus ( EBV ) infects cells in latent or lytic forms , but the roleof lytic infection in EBV - induced lymphomas is unclear .	B I I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Here , we have used anew humanized mouse model , in which both human fetal CD34 ( + ) hematopoietic stemcells and thymus / liver tissue are transplanted , to compare EBV pathogenesis andlymphoma formation following infection with a lytic replication - defectiveBZLF1 - deleted ( Z - KO ) virus or a lytically active BZLF1 ( + ) control .	O O O O O O O B O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both thecontrol and Z - KO viruses established long - term viral latency in all infectedanimals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The infection appeared well controlled in some animals , but otherseventually developed CD20 ( + ) diffuse large B cell lymphomas ( DLBCL ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Animalsinfected with the control virus developed tumors more frequently than Z - KOvirus - infected animals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Specific immune responses against EBV - infected B cellswere generated in mice infected with either the control virus or the Z - KOvirus .	O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O
In both cases , forms of viral latency ( type I and type IIB ) wereobserved that are less immunogenic than the highly transforming form ( type III ) commonly found in tumors of immunocompromised hosts , suggesting that immunepressure contributed to the outcome of the infection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results point to animportant role for lytic EBV infection in the development of B cell lymphomasin the context of an active host immune response .	O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serine - threonine ubiquitination mediates downregulation of BST - 2 / tetherin and relief of restricted virion release by HIV - 1 Vpu .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
The HIV - 1 protein Vpu counteracts the antiviral activity of the innate restriction factor BST - 2 / tetherin by a mechanism that partly depends on its interaction with Beta - TrCP , a substrate adaptor for an SCF ( Skp - Cullin 1 - F box ) E3 ubiquitin ligase complex .	O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This suggests that Vpu stimulates the ubiquitination of BST - 2 and that this underlies the relief of restriction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we show that Vpu stimulates ubiquitination of BST - 2 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mutation of all potential ubiquitination sites in the cytoplasmic domain of BST - 2 , including lysines , cysteines , serines , and threonines , abrogates Vpu - mediated ubiquitination .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , a serine - threonine - serine sequence specifically mediates the downregulation of BST - 2 from the cell surface and the optimal relief of restricted virion release .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Serine - threonine ubiquitination of BST - 2 is likely part of the mechanism by which Vpu counteracts innate defenses .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
R5 HIV env and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein cooperate to mediate fusion to naive CD4 + T Cells .	O B O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Naive CD4 ( 4 ) T cells are resistant to both HIV R5 env and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein ( VSV - G ) - mediated fusion .	O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O
However , viral particles carrying both HIV R5 env and VSV - G infect naive cells by an unexplained mechanism .	O O B O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
We show that VSV - G - pseudotyped virus cannot fuse to unstimulated cells because the viral particles cannot be endocytosed .	O O O B O O O O B O O O O O O O B O O O O O
However , virions carrying both HIV R5 env and VSV - G can fuse because CD4 binding allows viral uptake .	O O O O O B O O O B O O O O O O O O B O O
Our findings reveal a unique mechanism by which R5 HIV env and VSV - G cooperate to allow entry to naive CD4 ( + ) T cells , providing a tool to target naive CD4 ( + ) T cells with R5 HIV to study HIV coreceptor signaling and latency .	O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B O O O O O
A recombinant measles virus unable to antagonize STAT1 function cannot control inflammation and is attenuated in rhesus monkeys .	O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Measles remains a leading cause of death worldwide among children because it suppresses immune function .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The measles virus ( MV ) P gene encodes three proteins ( P , V , and C ) that interfere with innate immunity , controlling STAT1 , STAT2 , mda5 , and perhaps other key regulators of immune function .	O B I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We identified here three residues in the shared domain of the P and V proteins - tyrosine 110 , valine 112 , and histidine 115 - that function to retain STAT1 in the cytoplasm and inhibit interferon transcription .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This information was used to generate a recombinant measles virus unable to antagonize STAT1 function ( STAT1 - blind MV ) differing only in these three residues from a wild - type strain of well - defined virulence .	O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This virus was used to assess the relevance of P and V interactions with STAT1 for virulence in primates .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When a group of six rhesus monkeys ( Macaca mulatta ) was inoculated intranasally with STAT1 - blind MV , viremia was short - lived , and the skin rash and other clinical signs observed with wild - type MV were absent .	O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
The STAT1 - blind virus less efficiently controlled the inflammatory response , as measured by enhanced transcription of interleukin - 6 and tumor necrosis factor alpha in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from infected hosts .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Importantly , neutralizing antibody titers and MV - specific T - cell responses were equivalent in hosts infected with either virus .	O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings indicate that efficient MV interactions with STAT1 are required to sustain virulence in a natural host by controlling the inflammatory response against the virus .	O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They also suggest that selectively STAT1 - blind MV may have utility as vectors for targeted oncolysis and vaccination .	O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
RNA aptamers directed to human immunodeficiency virus type 1 Gag polyprotein bind to the matrix and nucleocapsid domains and inhibit virus production .	O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gag orchestrates the assembly and release of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 ( HIV - 1 ) particles .	O O O O O O O B I I I I O B I I O O O
We explored here the potential of anti - Gag RNA aptamers to inhibit HIV - 1 replication .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O
In vitro , RNA aptamers raised against an HIV - 1 Gag protein , lacking the N - terminal myristate and the C - terminal p6 ( DP6 - Gag ) , could bind to matrix protein ( MA ) , nucleocapsid protein ( NC ) , or entire DP6 - Gag protein .	O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Upon cotransfection with pNL4 - 3 . Luc molecular clone into 293T cells , six of the aptamers caused mild inhibition ( 2 - to 3 - fold ) in the extracellular capsid levels , and one aptamer displayed 20 - fold inhibition .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The reduction was not due to a release defect but reflected Gag mRNA levels .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hypothesized that the aptamers influence genomic RNA levels via perturbation of specific Gag - genomic RNA interactions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Binding studies revealed that the & quot ; NC - binders & quot ; specifically compete with the packaging signal ( psi ) of HIV - 1 for binding to DP6 - Gag .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Therefore , we tested the ability of two NC - binders to inhibit viruses containing psi - region deletions ( DeltaSL1 or DeltaSL3 ) and found that the NC - binders were no longer able to inhibit Gag synthesis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The inability of these aptamers to inhibit psi - deleted viruses correlated with the absence of competition with the corresponding psi transcripts lacking SL1 or SL3 for binding DP6 - Gag in vitro .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results indicate that the NC - binding aptamers disrupt Gag - genomic RNA interaction and negatively affect genomic RNA transcription , processing , or stability .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results reveal an essential interaction between HIV - 1 Gag and the psi - region that may be distinct from that which occurs during the encapsidation of genomic RNA .	O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , anti - Gag aptamers can be an effective tool to perturb Gag - genomic RNA interactions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Energy metabolism in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis .	O O O O O O O
Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) is characterised by the progressive degeneration of upper and lower motor neurons .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Besides motor neuron degeneration , ALS is associated with several defects in energy metabolism , including weight loss , hypermetabolism , and hyperlipidaemia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Most of these abnormalities correlate with duration of survival , and available clinical evidence supports a negative contribution of defective energy metabolism to the overall pathogenic process .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Findings from animal models of ALS support this view and provide insights into the underlying mechanisms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Altogether , these results have clinical consequences for the management of defective energy metabolism in patients with ALS and pave the way for future therapeutic interventions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A small protein required for the switch from { sigma } F to { sigma } G during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
A cascade of alternative sigma factors governs the program of developmental gene expression during sporulation in Bacillus subtilis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Little is known , however , about how the early - acting sigma factors are inactivated and replaced by the later - acting factors .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we identify a small protein , Fin ( formerly known as YabK ) , that is required for efficient switching from sigma ( F ) - to sigma ( G ) - directed gene expression in the forespore compartment of the developing sporangium .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The fin gene , which is conserved among Bacillus species and species of related genera , is transcribed in the forespore under the control of both sigma ( F ) and sigma ( G ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cells mutant for fin are unable to fully deactivate sigma ( F ) and , conversely , are unable to fully activate sigma ( G ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Consistent with their deficiency in sigma ( G ) - directed gene expression , fin cells are arrested in large numbers following the engulfment stage of sporulation , ultimately forming 50 - fold fewer heat - resistant spores than the wild type .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Based in part on the similarity of Fin to the anti - sigma ( G ) factor CsfB ( also called Gin ) , we speculate that Fin is an anti - sigma ( F ) factor which , by disabling sigma ( F ) , promotes the switch to late developmental gene expression in the forespore .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Activation of the SoxR regulon in Streptomyces coelicolor by the extracellular form of the pigmented antibiotic actinorhodin .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
The redox - sensitive transcription factor SoxR in enteric bacteria senses and regulates the cellular response to superoxide and nitric oxide .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In other bacterial groups , however , it may respond to redox - active small molecules , as demonstrated for pyocyanin sensing in pseudomonads .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The antibiotic - producing soil bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor contains a gene for an SoxR homologue ( SCO1697 ) whose DNA recognition helix is identical to that of Escherichia coli SoxR .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
Using the E . coli SoxR binding sequence , we predicted five candidate genes of the SoxR regulon and demonstrated that SoxR binds to their promoter regions and activates their expression concurrently with the production of the blue antibiotic actinorhodin ( a benzoisochromanequinone ) .	O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These genes encode a probable NADPH - dependent flavin reductase ( SCO2478 ) , an NADPH - dependent quinone reductase ( SCO4266 ) , an ABC transporter ( SCO7008 ) , a monooxygenase ( SCO1909 ) , and a hypothetical protein ( SCO1178 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Addition of actinorhodin to exponentially growing cells activated the expression of SoxR target genes in an SoxR - dependent manner .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The secreted gamma - actinorhodin was over 10 - fold more effective in activation than the intracellular form of actinorhodin , suggesting that SoxR is specified to respond more to exogenous signals than to intracellular metabolites .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The DeltasoxR mutant was not compromised in resistance against oxidants but was slow in forming aerial mycelium on R2YE medium with reduced sporulation , and its production of actinorhodin and undecylprodigiosin was lowered by about 50 % and 30 % , respectively , compared to that of the wild type .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results support the proposal that SoxR senses redox - active molecules , such as actinorhodin in S . coelicolor , and induces a protective function against them .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
It also functions to ensure that cells undergo optimal differentiation and secondary metabolite production .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Ecological trade - offs between jasmonic acid - dependent direct and indirect plant defences in tritrophic interactions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recent studies on plants genetically modified in jasmonic acid ( JA ) signalling support the hypothesis that the jasmonate family of oxylipins plays an important role in mediating direct and indirect plant defences .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the interaction of two modes of defence in tritrophic systems is largely unknown .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , we examined the preference and performance of a herbivorous leafminer ( Liriomyza huidobrensis ) and its parasitic wasp ( Opius dissitus ) on three tomato genotypes : a wild - type ( WT ) plant , a JA biosynthesis ( spr2 ) mutant , and a JA - overexpression 35S : : prosys plant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O B I O O O O B O B I O O O B O O O B I I I I I I O O B I I I I I O O O B I I I I I I I O
Their proteinase inhibitor production and volatile emission were used as direct and indirect defence factors to evaluate the responses of leafminers and parasitoids .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
Here , we show that although spr2 mutant plants are compromised in direct defence against the larval leafminers and in attracting parasitoids , they are less attractive to adult flies compared with WT plants .	O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Moreover , in comparison to other genotypes , the 35S : : prosys plant displays greater direct and constitutive indirect defences , but reduced success of parasitism by parasitoids .	O O O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Taken together , these results suggest that there are distinguished ecological trade - offs between JA - dependent direct and indirect defences in genetically modified plants whose fitness should be assessed in tritrophic systems and under natural conditions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The absence of sex - biased dispersal in the cooperatively breeding grey - crowned babbler .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O
Cooperatively breeding birds are thought to be especially vulnerable to habitat fragmentation , in part because dispersal is typically restricted for one sex , increasing the likelihood of inbreeding .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Knowledge of dispersal is essential to conservation efforts , but is often hampered by our inability to measure its frequency and distance when dispersal is infrequent and difficult to observe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Disrupted dispersal is a purported cause of decline in the Australian grey - crowned babbler ( Pomatostomus temporalis ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O B I O O
Both sexes of offspring delay dispersal for up to several years to help parents raise subsequent broods , yet little else is known about the dispersal of this cooperatively breeding woodland bird .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As both sexes appear to help , but only male helpers boost fledgling production , we hypothesized that males would be the more philopatric sex in this species , and that female grey - crowned babblers would disperse over greater distances .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I O O O O O O
To ensure reliable determination of sex and minimize bias towards detecting short - distance dispersal events , we combined molecular - based sexing and analyses of population genetic structure using polymorphic microsatellite loci with observational data obtained over multiple field seasons .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Observations of banded birds showed only infrequent fission of groups or short - distance dispersal ( mean = 854 m ) , but no apparent sex - bias in these patterns .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was significant genetic differentiation between social groups , but not between the sexes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Spatial genetic autocorrelation analysis of breeders revealed a random distribution of genotypes across the study area for both sexes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , contrary to expectations , we found no genetic evidence for restricted dispersal or for sex - biased dispersal over the 85 - km scale of this study , indicating that effective dispersal occurs over greater distances and more frequently than recoveries of banded birds indicated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that while constraints on independent breeding encourage high rates of philopatry , incest avoidance nonetheless drives high rates of dispersal by both sexes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In fragmented habitat , the dispersal dynamics of this cooperatively breeding species are unlikely to render them particularly vulnerable to genetic consequences such as inbreeding , but may lead to increased group dissolution .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dual Delta ^ 1 ^ 3C / delta ^ 1 ^ 8O response to water and nitrogen availability and its relationship with yield in field - grown durum wheat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The combined use of stable carbon and oxygen isotopes in plant matter is a tool of growing interest in cereal crop management and breeding , owing to its relevance for assessing the photosynthetic and transpirative performance under different growing conditions including water and N regimes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , this method has not been applied to wheat grown under real field conditions .	O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O
Here , plant growth , grain yield ( GY ) and the associated agronomic components , carbon isotope discrimination ( Delta ^ 1 ^ 3C ) plus oxygen isotope composition ( delta ^ 1 ^ 8O ) as well as leaf and canopy gas exchange were measured in field - grown wheat subjected to different water and N availabilities .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Water limitation was the main factor affecting yield , leaf and canopy gas exchange and Delta ^ 1 ^ 3C and delta ^ 1 ^ 8O , whereas N had a smaller effect on such traits .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The combination of Delta ^ 1 ^ 3C and delta ^ 1 ^ 8O gave a clear advantage compared with gas exchange measurements , as it provides information on the instantaneous and the long - term plant photosynthetic and transpirative performance and are less labour intensive than gas exchange measurements .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , the combination of plant Delta ^ 1 ^ 3C and delta ^ 1 ^ 8O predicted differences in GY and related agronomical parameters , providing agronomists and breeders with integrative traits for selecting crop management practices and / or genotypes with better performance under water - limiting and N - limiting conditions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Climate , history and neutrality as drivers of mammal beta diversity in Europe : insights from multiscale deconstruction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Environmental sorting , historical factors and neutral dynamics may all drive beta diversity ( change in species composition across space ) , but their relative importance remains unresolved .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In the case of European mammals , key potential drivers of large - scale beta diversity include current climate , neutral dynamics and two historical factors : Pleistocene glaciations and peninsular dynamics ( immigration from extra - regional eastern faunal source areas and inter - linked relictual survival and evolutionary differentiation in isolated areas ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We assessed the relative importance of these drivers using a novel analytical framework to deconstruct beta diversity of non - volant mammals in Europe ( 138 species ) into its turnover ( change in species composition because of species replacements ) and nestedness components ( change in species composition because of species richness differences ) at continental and regional ( 250 , 000 km ( 2 ) ) scales .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found continental - scale mammal beta diversity to be mainly caused by spatial turnover ( 99 * 9 % ) , with only a small contribution ( 0 * 1 % ) from nestedness .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Current climate emerged as an important driver of beta diversity , given the strong continental - scale turnover , particularly in north - south direction , i . e . , in line with the latitudinal climate gradient , and , more directly , the strong correlation of climate with spatial turnover at both continental and regional scales .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , there was also evidence for the importance of non - climatic drivers .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Notably , the compositional variation purely accounted for by space was greater than that purely accounted for by environment for both the turnover and the nestedness component of beta diversity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , the strong longitudinal turnover within Southern Europe is in accordance with the region ' s long - term climatic stability having allowed multiple refugia and local evolutionary diversification .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As expected from peninsular dynamics , there was increasing dissimilarity with geographic distance in an east - west direction because of nestedness , but only in Central and Northern Europe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In conclusion , European mammal beta diversity mainly reflects spatial turnover and only to a limited extent nestedness and is driven by current climate in combination with historical - and perhaps , neutral - dynamics .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that a key challenge for climate - change predictive studies will be taking the influence of non - climatic factors into account .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Bacterial protein secretion is a highly orchestrated process that is essential for infection and virulence .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite extensive efforts to predict or experimentally detect proteins that are secreted , the characterization of the bacterial secretome has remained challenging .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A central event in protein secretion is the type I signal peptidase ( SPase ) - mediated cleavage of the N - terminal signal peptide that targets a protein for secretion via the general secretory pathway , and the arylomycins are a class of natural products that inhibit SPase , suggesting that they may be useful chemical biology tools for characterizing the secretome .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , using an arylomycin derivative , along with two - dimensional gel electrophoresis and liquid chromatography - tandem mass spectrometry ( LC - MS / MS ) , we identify 11 proteins whose secretion from stationary - phase Staphylococcus epidermidis is dependent on SPase activity , 9 of which are predicted to be translated with canonical N - terminal signal peptides .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , we find that the presence of extracellular domains of lipoteichoic acid synthase ( LtaS ) and the Beta - lactam response sensor BlaR1 in the medium is dependent on SPase activity , suggesting that they are cleaved at noncanonical sites within the protein .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In all , the data define the proteins whose stationary - phase secretion depends on SPase and also suggest that the arylomycins should be valuable chemical biology tools for the study of protein secretion in a wide variety of different bacteria .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Aerobic degradation of mercaptosuccinate by the gram - negative bacterium Variovorax paradoxus strain B4 .	O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O
The Gram - negative bacterium Variovorax paradoxus strain B4 was isolated from soil under mesophilic and aerobic conditions to elucidate the so far unknown catabolism of mercaptosuccinate ( MS ) .	O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
During growth with MS this strain released significant amounts of sulfate into the medium .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Tn5 : : mob - induced mutagenesis was successfully employed and yielded nine independent mutants incapable of using MS as a carbon source .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In six of these mutants , Tn5 : : mob insertions were mapped in a putative gene encoding a molybdenum ( Mo ) cofactor biosynthesis protein ( moeA ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In two further mutants the Tn5 : : mob insertion was mapped in the gene coding for a putative molybdopterin ( MPT ) oxidoreductase .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to the wild type , these eight mutants also showed no growth on taurine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In another mutant a gene putatively encoding a 3 - hydroxyacyl - coenzyme A dehydrogenase ( paaH2 ) was disrupted by transposon insertion .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Upon subcellular fractionation of wild - type cells cultivated with MS as sole carbon and sulfur source , MPT oxidoreductase activity was detected in only the cytoplasmic fraction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cells grown with succinate , taurine , or gluconate as a sole carbon source exhibited no activity or much lower activity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
MPT oxidoreductase activity in the cytoplasmic fraction of the Tn5 : : mob - induced mutant Icr6 was 3 - fold lower in comparison to the wild type .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , a new pathway for MS catabolism in V . paradoxus strain B4 is proposed : ( i ) MPT oxidoreductase catalyzes the conversion of MS first into sulfinosuccinate ( a putative organo - sulfur compound composed of succinate and a sulfino group ) and then into sulfosuccinate by successive transfer of oxygen atoms , ( ii ) sulfosuccinate is cleaved into oxaloacetate and sulfite , and ( iii ) sulfite is oxidized to sulfate .	O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
African 2 , a clonal complex of Mycobacterium bovis epidemiologically important in East Africa .	O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
We have identified a clonal complex of Mycobacterium bovis isolated at high frequency from cattle in Uganda , Burundi , Tanzania , and Ethiopia .	O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
We have named this related group of M . bovis strains the African 2 ( Af2 ) clonal complex of M . bovis .	O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
Af2 strains are defined by a specific chromosomal deletion ( RDAf2 ) and can be identified by the absence of spacers 3 to 7 in their spoligotype patterns .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Deletion analysis of M . bovis isolates from Algeria , Mali , Chad , Nigeria , Cameroon , South Africa , and Mozambique did not identify any strains of the Af2 clonal complex , suggesting that this clonal complex of M . bovis is localized in East Africa .	O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
The specific spoligotype pattern of the Af2 clonal complex was rarely identified among isolates from outside Africa , and the few isolates that were found and tested were intact at the RDAf2 locus .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that the Af2 clonal complex is localized to cattle in East Africa .	O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
We found that strains of the Af2 clonal complex of M . bovis have , in general , four or more copies of the insertion sequence IS6110 , in contrast to the majority of M . bovis strains isolated from cattle , which are thought to carry only one or a few copies .	O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Isolation and characterization of P1 adhesin , a leg protein of the gliding bacterium Mycoplasma pneumoniae .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Mycoplasma pneumoniae , a pathogen causing human pneumonia , binds to solid surfaces at its membrane protrusion and glides by a unique mechanism .	B I O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , P1 adhesin , which functions as a & quot ; leg & quot ; in gliding , was isolated from mycoplasma culture and characterized .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Using gel filtration , blue - native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis ( BN - PAGE ) , and chemical cross - linking , the isolated P1 adhesin was shown to form a complex with an accessory protein named P90 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The complex included two molecules each of P1 adhesin and P90 ( protein B ) , had a molecular mass of about 480 kDa , and was observed by electron microscopy to form 20 - nm - diameter spheres .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Partial digestion of isolated P1 adhesin by trypsin showed that the P1 adhesin molecule can be divided into three domains , consistent with the results from trypsin treatment of the cell surface .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sequence analysis of P1 adhesin and its orthologs showed that domain I is well conserved and that a transmembrane segment exists near the link between domains II and III .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The peptidoglycan - binding protein FimV promotes assembly of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa type IV pilus secretin .	O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O
The Pseudomonas aeruginosa inner membrane protein FimV is among several proteins of unknown function required for type IV pilus - mediated twitching motility , arising from extension and retraction of pili from their site of assembly in the inner membrane .	O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pili transit the periplasm and peptidoglycan ( PG ) layer , ultimately exiting the cell through the PilQ secretin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although fimV mutants are nonmotile , they are susceptible to killing by pilus - specific bacteriophage , a hallmark of retractable surface pili .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
Here we show that levels of recoverable surface pili were markedly decreased in fimV pilT retraction - deficient mutants compared with levels in the pilT control , demonstrating that FimV acts at the level of pilus assembly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Levels of inner membrane assembly subcomplex proteins PilM / N / O / P were decreased in fimV mutants , but supplementation of these components in trans did not restore pilus assembly or motility .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Loss of FimV dramatically reduced the levels of the PilQ secretin multimer through which pili exit the cell , in part due to decreased levels of PilQ monomers , while PilF pilotin levels were unchanged .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Expression of pilQ in trans in the wild type or fimV mutants increased total PilQ monomer levels but did not alter secretin multimer levels or motility .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PG pulldown assays showed that the N terminus of FimV bound PG in a LysM motif - dependent manner , and a mutant with an in - frame chromosomal deletion of the LysM motif had reduced motility , secretin levels , and surface piliation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Together , our data show that FimV ' s role in pilus assembly is to promote secretin formation and that this function depends upon its PG - binding domain .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three motAB stator gene products in Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus contribute to motility of a single flagellum during predatory and prey - independent growth .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The predatory bacterium Bdellovibrio bacteriovorus uses flagellar motility to locate regions rich in Gram - negative prey bacteria , colliding and attaching to prey and then ceasing flagellar motility .	O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prey are then invaded to form a & quot ; bdelloplast & quot ; in a type IV pilus - dependent process , and prey contents are digested , allowing Bdellovibrio growth and septation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
After septation , Bdellovibrio flagellar motility resumes inside the prey bdelloplast prior to its lysis and escape of Bdellovibrio progeny .	O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Bdellovibrio can also grow slowly outside prey as long flagellate host - independent ( HI ) cells , cultured on peptone - rich media .	B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The B . bacteriovorus HD100 genome encodes three pairs of MotAB flagellar motor proteins , each of which could potentially form an inner membrane ion channel , interact with the FliG flagellar rotor ring , and produce flagellar rotation .	O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2004 , Flannagan and coworkers ( R . S . Flannagan , M . A . Valvano , and S . F . Koval , Microbiology 150 : 649 - 656 , 2004 ) used antisense RNA and green fluorescent protein ( GFP ) expression to downregulate a single Bdellovibrio motA gene and reported slowed release from the bdelloplast and altered motility of the progeny .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we inactivated each pair of motAB genes and found that each pair contributes to motility , both predatorily , inside the bdelloplast and during HI growth ; however , each pair was dispensable , and deletion of no pair abolished motility totally .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Driving - ion studies with phenamil , carbonyl cyanide m - chlorophenylhydrazone ( CCCP ) , and different pH and sodium conditions indicated that all Mot pairs are proton driven , although the sequence similarities of each Mot pair suggests that some may originate from halophilic species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , Bdellovibrio is a & quot ; dedicated motorist , & quot ; retaining and expressing three pairs of mot genes .	O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FAD binding by ApbE protein from Salmonella enterica : a new class of FAD - binding proteins .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O
The periplasmic protein ApbE was identified through the analysis of several mutants defective in thiamine biosynthesis and was implicated as having a role in iron - sulfur cluster biosynthesis or repair .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While mutations in apbE cause decreased activity of several iron - sulfur enzymes in vivo , the specific role of ApbE remains unknown .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Members of the AbpE family include NosX and RnfF , which have been implicated in oxidation - reduction associated with nitrous oxide and nitrogen metabolism , respectively .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this work , we show that ApbE binds one FAD molecule per monomeric unit .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The structure of ApbE in the presence of bound FAD reveals a new FAD - binding motif .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Protein variants that are nonfunctional in vivo were generated by random and targeted mutagenesis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Each variant was substituted in the environment of the FAD and analyzed for FAD binding after reconstitution .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The variant that altered a key tyrosine residue involved in FAD binding prevented reconstitution of the protein .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Serengeti food web : empirical quantification and analysis of topological changes under increasing human impact .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
To address effects of land use and human overexploitation on wildlife populations , it is essential to better understand how human activities have changed species composition , diversity and functioning .	O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O
Theoretical studies modelled how network properties change under human - induced , non - random species loss .	O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O
However , we lack data on realistic species - loss sequences in threatened , real - world food webs to parameterize these models .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we present a first size - structured topological food web of one of the most pristine terrestrial ecosystems in the world , the Serengeti ecosystem ( Tanzania ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The food web consists of 95 grouped nodes and includes both invertebrates and vertebrates ranging from body masses between 10 ( - 7 ) and 10 ( 4 ) kg .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We study the topological changes in this food web that result from the simulated IUCN - based species - loss sequence representing current species vulnerability to human disturbances in and around this savanna ecosystem .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O
We then compare this realistic extinction scenario with other extinction sequences based on body size and connectance and perform an analysis of robustness of this savanna food web .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We demonstrate that real - world species loss in this case starts with the biggest ( mega ) herbivores and top predators , causing higher predator - prey mass ratios .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , unlike theoretically modelled linear species deletion sequences , this causes poor - connected species to be lost first , while more highly connected species become lost as human impact progresses .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O
This food web shows high robustness to decreasing body size and increasing connectance deletion sequences compared with a high sensitivity to the decreasing connectance deletion scenario .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , based on the current knowledge of the Serengeti ecosystem , we discuss how the focus on food web topology alone , disregarding nontrophic interactions , may lead to an underestimation of human impacts on wildlife communities , with the number of trophic links affected by a factor of two .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study underlines the importance of integrative efforts between the development of food web theory and basic field work approaches in the quantification of the structure of interaction networks to sustain natural ecosystems in a changing world .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The osmosensing signal transduction pathway from Botrytis cinerea regulates cell wall integrity and MAP kinase pathways control melanin biosynthesis with influence of light .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mitogen activated protein kinase ( MAPK ) signal transduction pathways are ubiquitous among eukaryotic organisms with evolutionary conserved modules .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although generally classified as osmotic and cell wall integrity pathways , functional divergences have been observed for HOG1 - and SLT2 - related MAPK pathways .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here we show that the osmotic signal transduction cascade is involved in cell wall integrity in the phytopathogenic ascomycete Botrytis cinerea .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The deletion mutants of the upstream histidine kinase Bos1 and of the MAPK Sak1 showed modified tolerance to cell wall degrading enzymes and cell wall interfering agents , as well as increased staining of Beta1 - 3 glucan and chitin compared to the wild - type .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The Sak1 MAPK was phosphorylated upon cell wall challenging .	O O O O O O O O O O
Sak1 interfered with the phosphorylation status of the SLT2 type MAPK Bmp3 hinting to cross talk between both MAPK pathways .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All signal transduction components interfered with the expression of melanin biosynthesis genes in dark and bright , suggesting a coordinated control of melanin biosynthesis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Antimalarial drug resistance of Plasmodium falciparum in India : changes over time and space .	O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
After the launch of the National Malaria Control Programme in 1953 , the number of malaria cases reported in India fell to an all - time low of 0 * 1 million in 1965 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the initial success could not be maintained and a resurgence of malaria began in the late 1960s .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Resistance of Plasmodium falciparum to chloroquine was first reported in 1973 and increases in antimalarial resistance , along with rapid urbanisation and labour migration , complicated the challenge that India ' s large geographical area and population size already pose for malaria control .	O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although several institutions have done drug - resistance monitoring in India , a complete analysis of countrywide data across institutions does not exist .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We did a systematic review of P falciparum malaria drug - efficacy studies in India to summarise drug - resistance data and describe changes over the past 30 years to inform future policy .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Continued use of chloroquine for treatment of P falciparum malaria in India will likely be ineffective .	O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O
Resistance to sulfa - pyrimethamine should be closely monitored to protect the effectiveness of treatment with artesunate plus sulfadoxine - pyrimethamine , which is the new first - line treatment for P falciparum malaria .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O
Strategies to reduce the emergence and spread of future drug resistance need to be proactive and supported by intensive monitoring .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Endotoxin removal devices for the treatment of sepsis and septic shock .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
A substantial body of experimental and clinical evidence suggests that neutralising or removing lipopolysaccharide endotoxin would be an effective adjunctive approach to the management of Gram - negative sepsis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Polymyxins are a group of cyclic cationic polypeptide antibiotics .	O O O O O O O O O O
Although they have useful antimicrobial activity against Gram - negative bacteria , their clinical use has been limited because of toxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , in addition to their antimicrobial property , polymyxins can bind to and neutralise endotoxin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , investigators have explored the possibility of using polymyxin bound to a solid - phase carrier for specific haem - adsorption in patients with sepsis , thereby retaining the lipopolysaccharide - binding properties but minimising systemic toxic effects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This system has been widely used in Japan for many years , but convincing clinical evidence of efficacy is lacking .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A recent Italian study has some promising data .	O O O O O O O O O
Although polymyxin has been the principal agent used to explore this approach , other molecules have the ability to bind endotoxin , and some of these have very recently been proposed as the basis for other endotoxin - removal devices .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The available evidence is reviewed to assess the potential use of such devices in clinical practice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Genomics of biotrophic , plant - infecting plasmodiophorids using in vitro dual cultures .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The plasmodiophorids are a phylogenetically distinct group of parasitic protists that infect plants and stramenopiles , causing several important agricultural diseases .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Because of the obligate intracellular part of their lifecycle , none of the plasmodiophorids has been axenically cultured .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further , the molecular biology of the plasmodiophorids is poorly understood because pure cultures are not available from any species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We report on an in - vitro dual culture system of the plasmodiophorids Plasmodiophora brassicae and Spongospora subterranea with their respective plant hosts , Brassica rapa and Solanum tuberosum .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O B I O B I O
We show that these plasmodiophorids are capable of initiating and maintaining stable , long - term plant cell callus cultures in the absence of exogenous plant growth regulators .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We show that callus cultures harbouring S . subterranea provide an excellent starting material for gene discovery from this organism by constructing a pilot - scale DNA library .	O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Bioinformatic analysis of the sequences established that almost all of the DNA clones from this library were from S . subterranea rather than the plant host .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
The Spongospora genome was found to be rich in retrotransposable elements , and Spongospora protein - coding genes were shown to contain introns .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The sequence of a near full - length non - LTR retrotransposon was obtained , the first transposable element reported from a cercozoan protist .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Molecular characterization of three genes encoding aminopeptidases N in the poplar leaf beetle Chrysomela tremulae .	O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I O
Three genes encoding proteins showing sequence similarity and features typical of insect APNs were characterized in C . tremulae and designed as CtAPN1 , CtAPN2 and CtAPN3 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
Expression analysis of the three C . tremulae APN genes showed that CtAPN2 transcript is more abundant in the fat body , whereas both CtAPN1 and CtAPN3 are specifically expressed in the midgut .	O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite a similar genomic organization , lepidopteran and coleopteran APNs are phylogenetically distant , suggesting that APN gene duplication events occurred after these two insect orders split .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sequence and expression comparisons of CtAPN1 , CtAPN2 and CtAPN3 cDNAs in a C . tremulae Bacillus thuringiensis ( Bt ) - susceptible and in a Bt - resistant strain did not show any polymorphism at the amino acid level or difference at the transcription level .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I B I O B O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Alternative community compositional and dynamical states : the dual consequences of assembly history .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Much work on ecological consequences of community assembly history has focused on the formation of history - induced alternative stable equilibria .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hypothesize that assembly history may affect not only community composition but also population dynamics , with assembled communities differing in species composition potentially residing in different dynamical states .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We provided an empirical test of the aforementioned hypothesis using a laboratory microcosm experiment that manipulated both the colonization order of three bacterivorous protist species in the presence of a protist predator and environmental productivity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both priority effects and random divergence emerged , resulting in two different community compositional states : one characterized by the dominance of one prey species and the other by the extinction of the same prey .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
While communities in the former state exhibited noncyclic dynamics , the majority of communities in the latter state exhibited cyclic dynamics driven by the interaction between another prey and the predator .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Temporal variability of total prey community biovolume consequently differed among communities with different histories .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Changing productivity altered priority effects on the structure and dynamics of communities experiencing only certain histories .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results support the dual ( compositional and dynamical ) consequences of assembly history and emphasize the importance of incorporating the dynamical view into the field of community assembly .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Barcoding diatoms : exploring alternatives to COI - 5P .	O O O O O O O O O O
Diatoms are a diverse lineage with species that can be difficult to identify or cryptic , but DNA barcoding , a molecular technique , can assist identification and facilitate studies of speciation and biogeography .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The most common region used for DNA barcoding , COI - 5P , can distinguish diatom species , but has not displayed universality ( i . e . , successful PCR amplification from diverse taxa ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , we have assessed the following alternative markers : - 1400bp of rbcL ; 748bp at the 3 ' end of rbcL ( rbcL - 3P ) ; LSU D2 / D3 and UPA .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sellaphora isolates were used to determine each marker ' s ability to discriminate among closely related species and culture collection material was utilized to explore further marker universality .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All of the alternative markers investigated have greater universality than COI - 5P .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both full and partial ( 3P ) rbcL regions had the power to discriminate between all species , but rbcL - 3P can be sequenced more easily .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
LSU D2 / D3 could distinguish between all but the most closely related species ( 96 % ) , whereas UPA only distinguished 20 % of species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our observations suggest that rbcL - 3P should be used as the primary marker for diatom barcoding , while LSU D2 / D3 should be sequenced as a secondary marker to facilitate environmental surveys .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Genetic and molecular characterization of a blue light photoreceptor MGWC - 1 in Magnaporth oryzae .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Three key factors involved in successful plant disease development include the presence of a susceptible host , a virulent pathogen , and a disease - conducive environment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our understanding of how environmental factors influence disease - conducive or disease - suppressive conditions , and how a pathogen advantageously capitalizes on them , is quite limited .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Utilizing the model pathosystem Magnaporthe oryzae - Oryza sativa , we found a significant light - dependent disease suppression .	O O O O B I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
Our genetic data suggest that the blue - light receptor MGWC - 1 in M . oryzae is involved in light - dependent disease suppression during the dark - phase ( disease - conducive light condition ) immediately after pathogen - host contact .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sensing & quot ; darkness & quot ; is accomplished by MGWC - 1 , a blue - light receptor in M . oryzae .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O
To explore the potential molecular mechanisms of light - dependent disease suppression we performed a genome - wide microarray experiment and identified several groups of gene families that are differentially regulated during the light - to - dark transition .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our genetic and molecular data provide insights into how a fungal pathogen utilizes ambient light signals for successful disease development .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using tunable diode laser spectroscopy to measure carbon isotope discrimination and mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion dynamically at different CO2 concentrations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In C3 leaves , the mesophyll conductance to CO2 diffusion , g ( m ) , determines the drawdown in CO2 concentration from intercellular airspace to the chloroplast stroma .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Both g ( m ) and stomatal conductance limit photosynthetic rate and vary in response to the environment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We investigated the response of g ( m ) to changes in CO2 in two Arabidopsis genotypes ( including a mutant with open stomata , ost1 ) , tobacco and wheat .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We combined measurements of gas exchange with carbon isotope discrimination using tunable diode laser absorption spectroscopy with a CO2 calibration system specially designed for a range of CO2 and O2 concentrations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
CO2 was initially increased from 200 to 1000 ppm and then decreased stepwise to 200 ppm and increased stepwise back to 1000 ppm , or the sequence was reversed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In 2 % O2 a step increase from 200 to 1000 ppm significantly decreased g ( m ) by 26 - 40 % in all three species , whereas following a step decrease from 1000 to 200 ppm , the 26 - 38 % increase in g ( m ) was not statistically significant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The response of g ( m ) to CO2 was less in 21 % O2 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparing wild type against the ost1 revealed that mesophyll and stomatal conductance varied independently in response to CO2 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We discuss the effects of isotope fractionation factors on estimating g ( m ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Maternal , neonatal , and child health in southeast Asia : towards greater regional collaboration .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although maternal and child mortality are on the decline in southeast Asia , there are still major disparities , and greater equity is key to achieve the Millennium Development Goals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We used comparable cross - national data sources to document mortality trends from 1990 to 2008 and to assess major causes of maternal and child deaths .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We present inequalities in intervention coverage by two common measures of wealth quintiles and rural or urban status .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Case studies of reduction in mortality in Thailand and Indonesia indicate the varying extents of success and point to some factors that accelerate progress .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We developed a Lives Saved Tool analysis for the region and for country subgroups to estimate deaths averted by cause and intervention .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We identified three major patterns of maternal and child mortality reduction : early , rapid downward trends ( Brunei , Singapore , Malaysia , and Thailand ) ; initially high declines ( sustained by Vietnam but faltering in the Philippines and Indonesia ) ; and high initial rates with a downward trend ( Laos , Cambodia , and Myanmar ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Economic development seems to provide an important context that should be coupled with broader health - system interventions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increasing coverage and consideration of the health - system context is needed , and regional support from the Association of Southeast Asian Nations can provide increased policy support to achieve maternal , neonatal , and child health goals .

Cataloging and profiling genes expressed in Lentinula edodes fruiting body by massive cDNA pyrosequencing and LongSAGE .	O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O
This study investigated the molecular mechanism of the fruiting body development and sporulation in the cap of the Shiitake mushroom , Lentinula edodes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O
Although there has been much research into L . edodes , there remain significant gaps in our knowledge of how the species reproduces .	O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In order to provide molecular resources and to understand the molecular mechanism of the fruiting body development in basidiomycete comprehensively , we searched for the genes which are important for fruiting body development and sporulation in the cap of mature fruiting body of L . edodes by using the whole - genome approach .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
Massive cDNA pyrosequencing was used to generate > 7000 sequence contigs from mature fruiting bodies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We used Gene Ontology to categorize the contigs to form the catalog of genes expressed at the stage of the mature fruiting body .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We also assigned the contigs into the KEGG pathways .	O O O O O O O O O O
The catalog of expressed genes indicates that the mature fruiting bodies ( 1 ) sense the external environment , ( 2 ) transmit signals to express genes through regulatory systems , ( 3 ) produce many proteins , ( 4 ) degrade unwanted proteins , ( 5 ) perform extensive biosynthesis , ( 6 ) generate energy , ( 7 ) regulate the internal environment , ( 8 ) transport molecules , ( 9 ) carry out cell division , and ( 10 ) differentiate and develop .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After establishing the catalog of expressed genes in L . edodes , we used the LongSAGE approach to analyze the expression levels of genes found in mature fruiting bodies before ( FB ) and after ( FBS ) spores appeared .	O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Gene - expression patterns according to GO categories were similar in these two stages .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We have also successfully identified genes differentially expressed in FB and FBS .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fold - changes in expression levels of selected genes based on LongSAGE tag counts were similar to those obtained by real - time RT - PCR .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The consistency between real - time RT - PCR and LongSAGE results indicates reliability of the LongSAGE results .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall , this study provides valuable information on the fruiting processes of L . edodes through a combination of massive cDNA pyrosequencing and LongSAGE sequencing , and the knowledge thereby obtained may provide insight into the improvement of the yield of commercially grown Shiitake mushrooms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
A mutation in the Cc . ubc2 gene affects clamp cell morphogenesis as well as nuclear migration for dikaryosis in Coprinopsis cinerea .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The formation and proliferation of the dikaryon in the agaricomycete Coprinopsis cinerea is controlled by the mating type genes , A and B .	O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The B genes , which encode pheromones and pheromone receptors , control nuclear migration for dikaryosis as well as the fusion of the clamp cell with the subterminal cell while the A genes , which encode two classes of homeodomain proteins , control conjugate nuclear division associated with clamp connection development .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We characterized the mutant , B28 , which was newly isolated as a strain that fails to form a primary hyphal knot , the first visible sign toward fruiting , from a homokaryotic fruiting strain after REMI mutagenesis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Detailed phenotypic analysis revealed that strain B28 exhibits , in addition to the fruiting defect , a defect in A - regulated clamp cell morphogenesis as well as a defect in B - regulated nuclear migration for dikaryosis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mutant clamp cells are unique in that they continue growing like branches without fusing with the subterminal cells , in contrast to the unfused pseudoclamp which are normally formed in A - on B - off strains , providing evidence for the existence of an as yet unidentified mechanism for the growth suppression of the clamp cell .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Molecular analysis revealed that the gene responsible for the phenotypes , designated Cc . ubc2 , encodes a protein similar to Ubc2 , an adaptor protein for filamentous growth , pheromone response and virulence in the smut fungus Ustilago maydis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In addition , western blot analysis demonstrated that the Cc . ubc2 - 1 mutation blocks phosphorylation of a presumptive MAP kinase .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased sampling reveals novel lineages of Entamoeba : consequences of genetic diversity and host specificity for taxonomy and molecular detection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To expand the representation for phylogenetic analysis , ten additional complete Entamoeba small - subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained from humans , non - human primates , cattle and a tortoise .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O B O O O O
For some novel sequences no corresponding morphological data were available , and we suggest that these organisms should be referred to as ribosomal lineages ( RL ) rather than being assigned species names at present .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To investigate genetic diversity and host specificity of selected Entamoeba species , a total of 91 new partial small subunit rRNA gene sequences were obtained , including 49 from Entamoeba coli , 18 from Entamoeba polecki , and 17 from Entamoeba hartmanni .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O B I O O O O B I O
We propose a new nomenclature for significant variants within established Entamoeba species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Based on current data we propose that the uninucleated - cyst - producing Entamoeba infecting humans is called Entamoeba polecki and divided into four subtypes ( ST1 - ST4 ) and that Entamoeba coli is divided into two subtypes ( ST1 - ST2 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O
New hosts for several species were detected and , while host specificity and genetic diversity of several species remain to be clarified , it is clear that previous reliance on cultivated material has given us a misleading and incomplete picture of variation within the genus Entamoeba .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Definition and classification of cancer cachexia : an international consensus .	O O O O O O O O O O O
To develop a framework for the definition and classification of cancer cachexia a panel of experts participated in a formal consensus process , including focus groups and two Delphi rounds .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cancer cachexia was defined as a multifactorial syndrome defined by an ongoing loss of skeletal muscle mass ( with or without loss of fat mass ) that cannot be fully reversed by conventional nutritional support and leads to progressive functional impairment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Its pathophysiology is characterised by a negative protein and energy balance driven by a variable combination of reduced food intake and abnormal metabolism .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The agreed diagnostic criterion for cachexia was weight loss greater than 5 % , or weight loss greater than 2 % in individuals already showing depletion according to current bodyweight and height ( body - mass index [ BMI ] & lt ; 20 kg / m ( 2 ) ) or skeletal muscle mass ( sarcopenia ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An agreement was made that the cachexia syndrome can develop progressively through various stages - - precachexia to cachexia to refractory cachexia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Severity can be classified according to degree of depletion of energy stores and body protein ( BMI ) in combination with degree of ongoing weight loss .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Assessment for classification and clinical management should include the following domains : anorexia or reduced food intake , catabolic drive , muscle mass and strength , functional and psychosocial impairment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Consensus exists on a framework for the definition and classification of cancer cachexia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After validation , this should aid clinical trial design , development of practice guidelines , and , eventually , routine clinical management .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neuroinflammation in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis : role of glial activation in motor neuron disease .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer ' s disease , Parkinson ' s disease , and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) are characterised by the appearance of reactive microglial and astroglial cells , a process referred to as neuroinflammation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In transgenic mouse models of mutant SOD1 - associated familial ALS , reactive microglial cells and astrocytes actively contribute to the death of motor neurons .	O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The biological processes that drive this glial reaction are complex and have both beneficial and deleterious effects on motor neurons .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therapeutic interventions targeting these cells are being explored .	O O O O O O O O O
An improved understanding of the biological processes that cause neuroinflammation will help to define its medical importance and to identify the therapeutic potential of interfering with this reaction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Potassium and sodium uptake systems in fungi .	O O O O O O O O
The transporter diversity of Magnaporthe oryzae .	O O O O B I O
In this study , we report an inventory of the K ( + ) uptake systems in 62 fungal species for which the complete genome sequences are available .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This inventory reveals that three types of K ( + ) uptake systems , TRK and HAK transporters and ACU ATPases , are widely present in several combinations across fungal species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
PAT ATPases are less frequently present and are exceptional in Ascomycota .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The genome of Magnaporthe oryzae contains four TRK , one HAK , and two ACU genes .	O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O
The study of the expression of these genes at high K ( + ) , K ( + ) starvation , and in infected rice leaves revealed that the expression of four genes , ACU1 , ACU2 , HAK1 , and TRK1 is much lower than that of TRK2 , TRK3 , and TRK4 , except under K ( + ) starvation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The two ACU ATPases were cloned and functionally identified as high - affinity K ( + ) or Na ( + ) uptake systems .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These two ATPases endow Saccharomyces cerevisiae with the capacity to grow for several generations in low Na ( + ) concentrations when K ( + ) was absent , which produces a dramatic increase of cellular Na ( + ) / K ( + ) ratio .	O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Soil nutrient status determines how elephant utilize trees and shape environments .	O O O O O B O O O O O O
Elucidation of the mechanism determining the spatial scale of patch selection by herbivores has been complicated by the way in which resource availability at a specific scale is measured and by vigilance behaviour of the herbivores themselves .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
To reduce these complications , we studied patch selection by an animal with negligible predation risk , the African elephant .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
We introduce the concept of nutrient load as the product of patch size , number of patches and local patch nutrient concentration .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nutrient load provides a novel spatially explicit expression of the total available nutrients a herbivore can select from .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hypothesized that elephant would select nutrient - rich patches , based on the nutrient load per 2500 m ( 2 ) down to the individual plant scale , and that this selection will depend on the nitrogen and phosphorous contents of plants .	O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We predicted that elephant would cause more adverse impact to trees of lower value to them in order to reach plant parts with higher nutrient concentrations such as bark and root .	O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , elephant should maintain nutrient - rich trees by inducing coppicing of trees through re - utilization of leaves .	O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Elephant patch selection was measured in a homogenous tree species stand by manipulating the spatial distribution of soil nutrients in a large field experiment using NPK fertilizer .	B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Elephant were able to select nutrient - rich patches and utilized Colophospermum mopane trees inside these patches more than outside , at scales ranging from 2500 down to 100 m ( 2 ) .	B O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although both nitrogen and phosphorus contents of leaves from C . mopane trees were higher in fertilized and selected patches , patch choice correlated most strongly with nitrogen content .	O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As predicted , stripping of leaves occurred more in nutrient - rich patches , while adverse impact such as uprooting of trees occurred more in nutrient - poor areas .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
8 .	O O
Our results emphasize the necessity of including scale - dependent selectivity in foraging studies and how elephant foraging behaviour can be used as indicators of change in the availability of nutrients .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Social immunity in honeybees ( Apis mellifera ) : transcriptome analysis of varroa - hygienic behaviour .	O O O B O B I O O O O O O O O O O
Honeybees have evolved a social immunity consisting of the cooperation of individuals to decrease disease in the hive .	B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We identified a set of genes involved in this social immunity by analysing the brain transcriptome of highly varroa - hygienic bees , who efficiently detect and remove brood infected with the Varroa destructor mite .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The function of these candidate genes does not seem to support a higher olfactory sensitivity in hygienic bees , as previously hypothesized .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , comparing their genomic profile with those from other behaviours suggests a link with brood care and the highly varroa - hygienic Africanized honeybees .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
These results represent a first step toward the identification of genes involved in social immunity and thus provide first insights into the evolution of social immunity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Long - term outcomes of patients with aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage .	O O O O O O O O O O O
More and more patients survive aneurysmal subarachnoid haemorrhage ( aSAH ) , with case fatality decreasing by 17 % in absolute terms over the past three decades and incidence remaining relatively stable at nine per 100 , 000 patient - years .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean age at which aSAH occurs is reasonably young at 55 years , and people of this age in the general population have a good life expectancy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , there are few data for life expectancy after aSAH , and the risks of late recurrent aSAH and other vascular diseases are unclear .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The course of associated long - term physical and cognitive deficits after aSAH is not well established , leading to questions about potential outcomes to quality of life and working capacity , as well as best clinical practices .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Sporadic and familial hemiplegic migraine : pathophysiological mechanisms , clinical characteristics , diagnosis , and management .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Hemiplegic migraine is a rare form of migraine with aura that involves motor aura ( weakness ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This type of migraine can occur as a sporadic or a familial disorder .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Familial forms of hemiplegic migraine are dominantly inherited .	O O O O O O O O O
Data from genetic studies have implicated mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in ion transportation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , at least a quarter of the large families affected and most sporadic cases do not have a mutation in the three genes known to be implicated in this disorder , suggesting that other genes are still to be identified .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Results from functional studies indicate that neuronal hyperexcitability has a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of hemiplegic migraine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The clinical manifestations of hemiplegic migraine range from attacks with short - duration hemiparesis to severe forms with recurrent coma and prolonged hemiparesis , permanent cerebellar ataxia , epilepsy , transient blindness , or mental retardation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Diagnosis relies on a careful patient history and exclusion of potential causes of symptomatic attacks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The principles of management are similar to those for common varieties of migraine , except that vasoconstrictors , including triptans , are historically contraindicated but are often used off - label to stop the headache , and prophylactic treatment can include lamotrigine and acetazolamide .

The ciliate Parasterkiella thompsoni ( Foissner , 1996 ) nov . gen . , nov . comb .	O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
was originally described from Antarctica .	O O O O O O
In the present study , we report the morphology , morphogenesis during cell division , and molecular phylogeny inferred from the 18S - rDNA sequence of a population isolated from the Rancho Hambre peat bog , Tierra del Fuego Province ( Argentina ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The study is based on live and protargol - impregnated specimens .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Molecular phylogeny was inferred from trees constructed by means of the maximum parsimony , neighbor joining , and Bayesian analyses .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The interphase morphology matches the original description of the species .	O O O O O O O O O O O
During the cell division , stomatogenesis begins with the de novo proliferation of two fields of basal bodies , each one left of the postoral ventral cirri and of transverse cirri , which later unify .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Primordia IV - VI of the proter develop from disaggregation of cirrus IV / 3 , while primordium IV of the opisthe develops from cirrus IV / 2 and primordia V and VI from cirrus V / 4 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Dorsal morphogenesis occurs in the Urosomoida pattern - that is , the fragmentation of kinety 3 is lacking .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three macronuclear nodules are generated before cytokinesis .	O O O O O O O O
Phylogenetic analyses consistently placed P . thompsoni within the stylonychines .	O O O O B I I O O O O
New data on the morphogenesis of the dorsal ciliature justifies the transference of Sterkiella thompsoni to a new genus Parasterkiella .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O
Multiple environmental gradients affect spatial variation in the productivity of a tropical bird population .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Spatial variation in habitat quality and its demographic consequences have important implications for the regulation of animal populations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Theoretically , habitat quality is typically viewed as a single gradient from ' poor ' to ' good ' , but in wild populations it is possible that there are multiple environmental gradients that determine spatial variation in demography .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Understanding environmental gradients is important to gain mechanistic insights into important population processes , but also to understand how populations might respond to environmental change .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we explore habitat and elevation gradients and their implications for population persistence using detailed long - term data on 600 individuals of the Mauritius kestrel .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
These data allow us to statistically separate spatial variation in demography from variation arising out of individual or environmental quality and explore its relationships with habitat and topography .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Birds that breed earlier in the season have higher reproductive success , and we found that the timing of breeding varies significantly between territories .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This variation is primarily driven by elevation , with birds breeding progressively later as elevation increases .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pre - fledging survival from the egg to fledgling stage ( independently of timing ) , and recruitment , also varied significantly between territories .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This variation is driven by the habitat surrounding breeding sites with increasing agricultural encroachment causing survival and recruitment to decline .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Taken together , our results suggest that there are likely to be multiple environmental gradients affecting spatial variation in productivity in wild populations , and hence multiple and different routes through which environmental change might have consequences for population dynamics by modifying spatial processes .

Optimisation of breast cancer management in low - resource and middle - resource countries : executive summary of the Breast Health Global Initiative consensus , 2010 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The purpose of the Breast Health Global Initiative ( BHGI ) 2010 summit was to provide a consensus analysis of breast cancer control issues and implementation strategies for low - income and middle - income countries ( LMCs ) , where advanced stages at presentation and poor diagnostic and treatment capacities contribute to lower breast cancer survival rates than in high - income countries .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Health system and patient - related barriers were identified that create common clinical scenarios in which women do not present for diagnosis until their cancer has progressed to locally advanced or metastatic stages .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
As countries progress to higher economic status , the rate of late presentation is expected to decrease , and diagnostic and treatment resources are expected to improve .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Health - care systems in LMCs share many challenges including national or regional data collection , programme infrastructure and capacity ( including appropriate equipment and drug acquisitions , and professional training and accreditation ) , the need for qualitative and quantitative research to support decision making , and strategies to improve patient access and compliance as well as public , health - care professional , and policy - maker awareness that breast cancer is a cost - effective , treatable disease .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The biggest challenges identified for low - income countries were little community awareness that breast cancer is treatable , inadequate advanced pathology services for diagnosis and staging , and fragmented treatment options , especially for the administration of radiotherapy and the full range of systemic treatments .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The biggest challenges identified for middle - resource countries were the establishment and maintenance of data registries , the coordination of multidisciplinary centres of excellence with broad outreach programmes to provide community access to cancer diagnosis and treatment , and the resource - appropriate prioritisation of breast cancer control programmes within the framework of existing , functional health - care systems .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Stillbirths : what difference can we make and at what cost ?	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Worldwide , 2 * 65 million ( uncertainty range 2 * 08 million to 3 * 79 million ) stillbirths occur yearly , of which 98 % occur in countries of low and middle income .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Despite the fact that more than 45 % of the global burden of stillbirths occur intrapartum , the perception is that little is known about effective interventions , especially those that can be implemented in low - resource settings .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We undertook a systematic review of randomised trials and observational studies of interventions which could reduce the burden of stillbirths , particularly in low - income and middle - income countries .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We identified several interventions with sufficient evidence to recommend implementation in health systems , including periconceptional folic acid supplementation or fortification , prevention of malaria , and improved detection and management of syphilis during pregnancy in endemic areas .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric care were identified as key effective interventions to reduce intrapartum stillbirths .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Broad - scale implementation of intervention packages across 68 countries listed as priorities in the Countdown to 2015 report could avert up to 45 % of stillbirths according to a model generated from the Lives Saved Tool .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The overall costs for these interventions are within the general estimates of cost - effective interventions for maternal care , especially in view of the effects on outcomes across maternal , fetal , and neonatal health .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
New insights into the excystation process and oocyst morphology of rodent Eimeria species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , the mechanism of excystation of the rodent parasites Eimeria nieschulzi , from rats , and Eimeria falciformis , from mice , was investigated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
In vitro , oocysts of both species are susceptible to the protease pepsin , and sporocysts and sporozoites can be excysted in a similar way .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Scanning electron microscopy ( SEM ) revealed a collapse of the oocysts wall at both polar ends after pepsin treatment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This occurs without any visible damage of the outer wall .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Using fluorescence and transmission electron microscopy ( TEM ) we observed that pepsin enters sporulated oocysts at both polar ends and causes degradation of the inner oocyst wall .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Using scanning electron microscopy we could identify two polar caps in both investigated rodent Eimeria species , but only one is harbouring the micropyle .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus the polar caps are the entry site for the pepsin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , we provide evidence that the oocyst cap and micropyle are functionally different structures .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study complements the morphological description of both Eimeria species and is of relevance for other coccidian species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
First description of the early stage biology of the genus Mygona : the natural history of the satyrine butterfly , Mygona irmina in eastern Ecuador .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
The immature stages and natural history of Mygona irmina Doubleday ( Lepidoptera : Nymphalidae : Satyrinae : Pronophilina ) from northeastern Ecuadorian cloud forests are described based on 17 rearings .	O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dwarf bamboo , Chusquea c . f . scandens Kunth ( Poaceae , Bambusoidea ) is the larval food plant .	O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Eggs are laid singly on the bottom side of mature host plant leaves .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Larvae take 102 - 109 days to mature from egg to adult .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Adults are encountered most frequently on sunny days , flying rapidly over areas dominated by their food plant or feeding on the ground at mammal feces .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Males are often encountered inside large forest gaps near patches of bamboo guarding perches in the mid - canopy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One size does not fit all : flexible models are required to understand animal movement across scales .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Large data sets containing precise movement data from free - roaming animals are now becoming commonplace .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One means of analysing individual movement data is through discrete , random walk - based models .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Random walk models are easily modified to incorporate common features of animal movement , and the ways that these modifications affect the scaling of net displacement are well studied .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , ecologists have begun to explore more complex statistical models with multiple latent states , each of which are characterized by a distribution of step lengths and have their own unimodal distribution of turning angles centred on one type of turn ( e . g . reversals ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we introduce the compound wrapped Cauchy distribution , which allows for multimodal distributions of turning angles within a single state .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
When used as a single state model , the parameters provide a straightforward summary of the relative contributions of different turn types .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The compound wrapped Cauchy distribution can also be used to build multiple state models .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hypothesize that a multiple state model with unimodal distributions of turning angles will best describe movement at finer resolutions , while a multiple state model using our multimodal distribution will better describe movement at intermediate temporal resolutions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At coarser temporal resolutions , a single state model using our multimodal distribution should be sufficient .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We parameterize and compare the performance of these models at four different temporal resolutions ( 1 , 4 , 12 and 24 h ) using data from eight individuals of Loxodonta cyclotis and find support for our hypotheses .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O
We assess the efficacy of the different models in extrapolating to coarser temporal resolution by comparing properties of data simulated from the different models to the properties of the observed data .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
At coarser resolutions , simulated data sets recreate many aspects of the observed data ; however , only one of the models accurately predicts step length , and all models underestimate the frequency of reversals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The single state model we introduce may be adequate to describe movement data at many resolutions and can be interpreted easily .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Multiscalar analyses of movement such as the ones presented here are a useful means of identifying inconsistencies in our understanding of movement .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Effects of temperature on the development and population growth of the sycamore lace bug , Corythucha ciliata .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I O
The sycamore lace bug , Corythucha ciliata ( Say ) ( Hemiptera : Tingidae ) , is an important invasive exotic pest of Platanus ( Proteales : Platanaceae ) trees in China .	O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of temperature on C . ciliata in the laboratory so that forecasting models based on heat accumulation units could be developed for the pest .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Development and fecundity of C . ciliata reared on leaves of London plane tree ( Platanus x acerifolia ) were investigated at seven constant temperatures ( 16 , 19 , 22 , 26 , 30 , 33 , and 36 ^ 0 C ) and at a relative humidity of 80 % with a photoperiod of 14 : 10 ( L : D ) .	O O O O B I I O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The developmental time was found to significantly decrease with increasing temperature .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
The developmental time from egg hatching to adult emergence was respectively 47 . 6 , 35 . 0 , 24 . 1 , 20 . 0 , and 17 . 1 days at the temperatures of 19 , 22 , 26 , 30 , and 33 ^ 0 C .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
C . ciliata could not complete full development at 16 ^ 0 and 36 ^ 0 C .	B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The developmental threshold temperature ( C ) estimated for egg - to - adult was 11 . 17 ^ 0 C , with a thermal constant of ( K ) 370 . 57 degree - days .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Longevity of females was found to be the shortest , 17 . 7 days at 33 ^ 0 C and the longest , 58 . 9 days at 16 ^ 0 C , and that of males was the shortest , 19 . 7 days at 33 ^ 0 C and the longest , 59 . 7 days at 16 ^ 0 C .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fecundity was the highest at 30 ^ 0 C , being 286 . 8 eggs per female over an oviposition period of 8 . 9 days .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Female lifetime fecundity was reduced at other temperatures , being the lowest ( 87 . 7 eggs per female ) at 19 ^ 0 C .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The population trend index ( I ) of C . ciliata was the highest ( 130 . 1 ) at 30 ^ 0 C and the lowest ( 24 . 9 ) at 19 ^ 0 C .	O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , the optimal developmental temperature for C . ciliata was determined to be 30 ^ 0 C .	O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O
Parasitism of lepidopterous stem borers in cultivated and natural habitats .	O O O O O O O O O O O
Plant infestation , stem borer density , parasitism , and parasitoid abundance were assessed during two years in two host plants , Zea mays ( L . ) ( Cyperales : Poaceae ) and Sorghum bicolor ( L . ) ( Cyperales : Poaceae ) , in cultivated habitats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O
The four major host plants ( Cyperus spp . , Panicum spp . , Pennisetum spp . , and Sorghum spp . ) found in natural habitats were also assessed , and both the cultivated and natural habitat species occurred in four agroecological zones in Kenya .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Across habitats , plant infestation ( 23 . 2 % ) , stem borer density ( 2 . 2 per plant ) , and larval parasitism ( 15 . 0 % ) were highest in maize in cultivated habitats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O
Pupal parasitism was not higher than 4 . 7 % in both habitats , and did not vary with locality during each season or with host plant between each season .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Cotesia sesamiae ( Cameron ) and C . flavipes Cameron ( Hymenoptera : Braconidae ) were the key parasitoids in cultivated habitats ( both species accounted for 76 . 4 % of parasitized stem borers in cereal crops ) , but not in natural habitats ( the two Cotesia species accounted for 14 . 5 % of parasitized stem borers in wild host plants ) .	B I I I I O B I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
No single parasitoid species exerted high parasitism rates on stem borer populations in wild host plants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Low stem borer densities across seasons in natural habitats indicate that cereal stem borer pests do not necessarily survive the non - cropping season feeding actively in wild host plants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although natural habitats provided refuges for some parasitoid species , stem borer parasitism was generally low in wild host plants .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Overall , because parasitoids contribute little in reducing cereal stem borer pest populations in cultivated habitats , there is need to further enhance their effectiveness in the field to regulate these pests .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DNA methylation in insects : on the brink of the epigenomic era .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O
DNA methylation plays an important role in gene regulation in animals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the evolution and function of DNA methylation has only recently emerged as the subject of widespread study in insects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this review we profile the known distribution of DNA methylation systems across insect taxa and synthesize functional inferences from studies of DNA methylation in insects and vertebrates .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike vertebrate genomes , which tend to be globally methylated , DNA methylation is primarily targeted to genes in insects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Nevertheless , mounting evidence suggests that a specialized role exists for genic methylation in the regulation of transcription , and possibly mRNA splicing , in both insects and mammals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Investigations in several insect taxa further reveal that DNA methylation is preferentially targeted to ubiquitously expressed genes and may play a key role in the regulation of phenotypic plasticity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We suggest that insects are particularly amenable to advancing our understanding of the biological functions of DNA methylation , because insects are evolutionarily diverse , display several lineage - specific losses of DNA methylation and possess tractable patterns of DNA methylation in moderately sized genomes .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The small GTPase BcCdc42 affects nuclear division , germination and virulence of the gray mold fungus Botrytis cinerea .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
The small GTPase Cdc42 plays a central role in various processes in eukaryotic cells including growth , differentiation and cytoskeleton organization .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Whereas it is essential in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae , its role in filamentous fungi differs , due to the complementing , partly overlapping function of Rac .	O O O O O O B B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We analyzed the role of the Cdc42 homologue in the necrotrophic , broad host range pathogen Botrytis cinerea .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Deletion mutants of bccdc42 showed various growth abnormalities ; the mutants had reduced growth rate and hyphal branching , they produced fewer conidia , which were enlarged and misshapen and had germination defects .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , the mutants were impaired in sclerotia development .	O O O O O O O O O O
Cytological studies indicate that at least part of this phenotype could be attributed to disturbed control of nuclear division : conidia and hyphae of the mutant showed twofold higher nucleus / cytoplasm ratio compared to wild type cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Apart from these effects on vegetative growth and differentiation , Deltabccdc42 strains were attenuated in penetration and colonization of host tissue , confirming that BcCdc42 - though being not essential like in yeast - is involved in important developmental processes in B . cinerea .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O B I I O
GintAMT2 , a new member of the ammonium transporter family in the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Glomus intraradices .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O
In the symbiotic association of plants and arbuscular mycorrhizal ( AM ) fungi , the fungus delivers mineral nutrients , such as phosphate and nitrogen , to the plant while receiving carbon .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Previously , we identified an NH ( 4 ) ( + ) transporter in the AM fungus Glomus intraradices ( GintAMT1 ) involved in NH ( 4 ) ( + ) uptake from the soil when preset at low concentrations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Here , we report the isolation and characterization of a new G . intraradicesNH ( 4 ) ( + ) transporter gene ( GintAMT2 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O
Yeast mutant complementation assays showed that GintAMT2 encodes a functional NH ( 4 ) ( + ) transporter .	B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The use of an anti - GintAMT2 polyclonal antibody revealed a plasma membrane location of GintAMT2 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GintAMT1 and GintAMT2 were differentially expressed during the fungal life cycle and in response to N .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast to GintAMT1 , GintAMT2 transcript levels were higher in the intraradical than in the extraradical fungal structures .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , transcripts of both genes were detected in arbuscule - colonized cortical cells .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
GintAMT1 expression was induced under low N conditions .	O O O O O O O O O
Constitutive expression of GintAMT2 in N - limiting conditions and transitory induction after N re - supply suggests a role for GintAMT2 to retrieve NH ( 4 ) ( + ) leaked out during fungal metabolism .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Modulation of fungal sensitivity to staurosporine by targeting proteins identified by transcriptional profiling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
An analysis of the time - dependent genetic response to the death - inducer staurosporine was performed in Neurospora crassa by transcriptional profiling .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
Staurosporine induced two major genes encoding an ABC transporter and a protein with similarity to regulatory subunits of potassium channels .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The transcriptional response is dependent on the activity of a novel transcription factor .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Deletion mutants in differentially expressed genes displayed altered sensitivity to staurosporine , underscoring significant proteins involved in the response to the drug .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A null - mutant of the ABC transporter ( abc3 ) is extremely sensitive to staurosporine , accumulates more staurosporine than the wild type strain and is defective in energy - dependent export of the drug , indicating that the ABC3 protein is the first described staurosporine transporter .

It was located in the plasma membrane by immunofluorescence microscopy .	O O O O O O O O O O O
The combination of inhibitors of ABC transporters or of potassium channels with staurosporine leads to an enhanced activity against N . crassa and pathogenic fungi paving the way to the development of more potent and specific antifungals .

Our results highlight the general use of transcriptional profiling for the identification of novel proteins involved in cell death and their potential use as drug targets .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Novel Fusarium head blight pathogens from Nepal and Louisiana revealed by multilocus genealogical concordance .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study was conducted to assess evolutionary relationships , species diversity and trichothecene toxin potential of five Fusarium graminearum complex ( FGSC ) isolates identified as genetically novel during prior Fusarium head blight ( FHB ) surveys in Nepal and Louisiana .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Results of a multilocus genotyping ( MLGT ) assay for B - trichothecene species determination indicated these isolates might represent novel species within the FGSC .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
GCPSR - based phylogenetic analyses of a 12 - gene dataset , comprising portions of seven loci totaling 13 . 1kb of aligned DNA sequence data , provided strong support for the genealogical exclusivity of the Nepalese and Louisianan isolates .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Accordingly , both species are formally recognized herein as novel FGSC species .	O O O O O O O O O O B I O
Fusarium nepalense was resolved as the sister lineage of Fusarium ussurianum + Fusarium asiaticum within an Asian subclade of the FGSC .	B I O O O O O O O B I I I I O O O O O O B O
Fusarium louisianense was strongly supported as a reciprocally monophyletic sister of Fusarium gerlachii + F . graminearum , suggesting that this subclade might be endemic to North America .	B I O O O O O O O O O B I I I I I O O O O O O O O O O O O
Multilocus Bayesian species tree analyses augment these results and provide evidence for a distinct lineage within F . graminearum predominately from the Gulf Coast of Louisiana .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O
As predicted by the MLGT assay , mycotoxin analyses demonstrated that F . nepalense and F . louisianense could produce 15ADON and nivalenol , respectively , in planta .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , both species were only able to induce mild FHB symptoms on wheat in pathogenicity experiments .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparative Impact of Artificial Selection for Fungicide Resistance on Beauveria bassiana and Metarhizium brunneum .	O O O O O O O O O B I O B I O
Hypocreales fungi such as Beauveria bassiana ( Balsamo ) Vuillemin and Metarhizium brunneum Petch can be negatively affected by fungicides thereby reducing their biocontrol potential .	O O O O B I O O O O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In a previous study , we demonstrated enhanced fungicide resistance in B . bassiana through artificial selection .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O
However , it is not clear if the enhanced resistance was because of improved germination , vegetative growth , or both .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , the enhanced fungicide resistance has only been demonstrated in B . bassiana , and therefore it is of interest to investigate the potential to enhance resistance in other fungi .	O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , the objectives in this study were to determine the potential to enhance fungicide resistance in M . brunneum through artificial selection , and investigate if selection is based on germination , vegetative growth , or both in B . bassiana and M . brunneum .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O B I I O
Selection for resistance to fenbuconazole , and triphenyltin hydroxide was assessed through inhibition evaluations on solid media , and germination and mycelial growth in liquid media .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Increased resistance after selection was observed for all fungicide - fungus combinations on solid and or liquid media .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Selection resulted in increased resistance to fenbuconazole in both fungi in solid and liquid media ; in liquid culture fungicide resistance in B . bassiana was manifested by increased germination and mycelial growth , whereas in M . brunneum fungicide resistance concerned only mycelial growth .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O O
Selection for resistance to triphenyltin hydroxide varied in the different media .	O O O O O O O O O O O O
For B . bassiana , triphenyltin hydroxide resistance was enhanced on solid media but not in liquid , whereas enhanced resistance of M . brunneum was detected in both media .	O B I I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I I O O O O O O
Fungicide sensitivity and selection potential differs based on the medium and fungal species .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Selection for fungicide resistance , had negative effects on other beneficial traits when fungicide pressure was removed , for example , some selected populations showed decreased germination or growth , relative to their nonselected control populations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Additionally , reduced virulence to the greater wax moth , Galleria mellonella ( L . ) , was observed in all fungal populations that were exposed to fungicide resistance regimes .	O O O O O O B I I O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that it is possible to use genetic selection to enhance fungicide resistance in B . bassiana and M . brunneum , but before use the resulting populations should be screened for inadvertent negative impacts on beneficial traits .

Dispersion Models and Sampling of Cacao Mirid Bug Sahlbergella singularis ( Hemiptera : Miridae ) on Theobroma Cacao in Southern Cameroon .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B I O O O O
The spatio - temporal distribution of Sahlbergella singularis Haglung , a major pest of cacao trees ( Theobroma cacao ) ( Malvaceae ) , was studied for 2 yr in traditional cacao forest gardens in the humid forest area of southern Cameroon .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O B I O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O O O O O O O O O O
The first objective was to analyze the dispersion of this insect on cacao trees .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
The second objective was to develop sampling plans based on fixed levels of precision for estimating S . singularis populations .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The following models were used to analyze the data : Taylor ' s power law , Iwao ' s patchiness regression , the Nachman model , and the negative binomial distribution .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Our results document that Taylor ' s power law was a better fit for the data than the Iwao and Nachman models .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Taylor ' s b and Iwao ' s Beta were both significantly & gt ; 1 , indicating that S . singularis aggregated on specific trees .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This result was further supported by the calculated common k of 1 . 75444 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Iwao ' s alpha was significantly & lt ; 0 , indicating that the basic distribution component of S . singularis was the individual insect .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Comparison of negative binomial ( NBD ) and Nachman models indicated that the NBD model was appropriate for studying S . singularis distribution .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Optimal sample sizes for fixed precision levels of 0 . 10 , 0 . 15 , and 0 . 25 were estimated with Taylor ' s regression coefficients .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Required sample sizes increased dramatically with increasing levels of precision .	O O O O O O O O O O O
This is the first study on S . singularis dispersion in cacao plantations .	O O O O O O O O O O O B O O
Sampling plans , presented here , should be a tool for research on population dynamics and pest management decisions of mirid bugs on cacao .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B O
