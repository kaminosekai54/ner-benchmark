Actually	O
I	O

up	O
in	O
the	O
a-	O


you	O
know	O
when	O
I	O
was	O
in	O
graduate	O

I	O
spent	O
a	O
lot	O
of	O
time	O
in	O
my	O
last	O
year	O
of	O
college	O
thinking	O
about	O
whether	O

wanted	O
to	O
teach	O
little	O
kids	O

And	O
I	O
knew	O
it	O
was	O
obviously	O
because	O
what	O
I	O
really	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
was	O
go	O
into	O

also	O

of	I-DATE
the	I-DATE
year	I-DATE
I	O
'd	O

I	O
really	O


Daddy	O
was	O
really	O
going	O
to	O
be	O
the	O
one	O
.	O


I	O
got	O
very	O
unhappy	O
with	O
the	O
science	O
.	O


and	O
I	O
just	O
walked	O
out	O
of	O
one	O
lab	O


and	O
I	O
said	O
no	O
this	O
is	O
it	O
.	O


I	O
just	O
do	O
n't	O
want	O
it	O
.	O


I	O
wanted	O
to	O
be	O
teaching	O

Because	O
Daddy	O
was	O
at	O
that	O
point	O
noncommittal	O
to	O

the	O
least	O

%um	O
and	O
he	O
was	O
also	O
leaving	O

a	O
friend	O
of	O
mine	O
sat	O
down	O
with	O
me	O
,	O
Wayne	B-PERSON
Meyers	I-PERSON


and	O
he	O
said	O
he	O
was	O
a	O
very	O
bright	O
guy	O

He	O
was	O
the	O
one	O
whose	O
shoulder	O
I	O
cried	O
on	O
when	O
I	O
took	O
Dexadrin	B-PRODUCT
that	O
time	O
too	O
for	O


the	O
doctor	O
had	O
given	O
it	O
to	O
me	O
for	O

and	O
I	O
ended	O
up	O
getting	O
%um	O
depressed	O
for	O
twenty	B-TIME

four	I-TIME
hours	I-TIME

%um	O
and	O
he	O

to	O
me	O
you	O

I	O
said	O
yeah	O
I	O
really	O

He	O
says	O
well	O
take	O
the	O
bus	O
across	O
the	O

this	O
afternoon	O
because	O
I	O
had	O
already	O

been	O
accepted	O
to	O
the	O


I	O

it	O
went	O
so	O
far	O
that	O
I	O
applied	O
both	O
to	O
biophysics	O
and	O
to	O
%um	O
Harvard	B-ORG

And	O
I	O
did	O
n't	O
apply	O

any	O

because	O
I	O
figured	O
I	O
could	O

in	O
there	O
which	O
I	O
had	O

And	O
I	O
went	O
across	O
the	O

that	O
day	O


and	O
I	O
said	O
can	O
I	O
get	O
into	O
your	O

's	O
class	O

And	O
they	O

And	O
I	O

by	O
then	O
it	O
was	O
like	O
May	B-DATE

Certainly	O

And	O
I	O
remember	O
Mama	O
Sadie	B-PERSON
was	O
upset	O
about	O
it	O

But	O
everybody	O
knew	O
why	O
I	O
was	O
doing	O
it	O


and	O
everybody	O
kn-	O


it	O
was	O
obvious	O
even	O
to	O
Daddy	O
why	O
I	O
had	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
for	O
a	O
while	O

I	O
could	O
n't	O
just	O
study	O

I	O
was	O
twenty	B-DATE

two	I-DATE
already	O

%um	O
and	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
any	O
rational	O

Liz	B-PERSON
.	O


It	O
's	O
hormonal	O
.	O


It	O
's	O
absolutely	O
hormonal	O
.	O


I	O
mean	O
here	O
you	O
are	O
,	O


you	O
are	O
thirty	O
.	O


And	O
it	O
's	O
no	O
wonder	O
that	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
you	O
want	O
to	O
do	O
.	O


I	O
did	O
n't	O
know	O
what	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
do	O
at	O
that	O
stage	O
.	O


Well	O
I	O
did	O


but	O
it	O
was	O
out	O
of	O
reach	O
.	O


And	O
for	O
you	O
it	O
's	O
obviously	O
out	O
of	O
reach	O
too	O
.	O


Unless	O
it	O
works	O
out	O
with	O
Matt	B-PERSON
you	O
have	O
n't	O
met	O
him	O
.	O


And	O
therefore	O
I	O
'm	O
disappointed	O
in	O
how	O
you	O
're	O
going	O
about	O
it	O
because	O
I	O
've	O
known	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
who	O
did	O
n't	O
get	O
married	O
and	O
so	O
many	O
people	O
who	O
got	O
married	O
too	O
late	O
to	O
have	O
children	O
.	O


It	O
's	O
very	O
sad	O
.	O


I	O
find	O
it	O
very	O
sad	O
.	O


I	O
did	O
n't	O
expect	O
that	O
I	O
would	O
be	O
in	O
this	O
position	O
with	O
my	O
children	O
.	O


Well	O
actually	O
I	O
expected	O
it	O
with	O
Jonathan	B-PERSON
.	O


I	O
expected	O
to	O
worry	O
about	O
him	O
not	O
you	O
because	O
he	O
was	O
very	O
slow	O
socially	O
.	O


and	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
never	O
can	O
tell	O
with	O
life	O
.	O


There	O
are	O
n't	O
any	O
rules	O
about	O
it	O


and	O
%uh	O
nobody	O
has	O
written	O
the	O
future	O
.	O


And	O
it	O
's	O
%uh	O
%eh	O
prayer	O


and	O
%uh	O
%eh	O
penitence	O
does	O
n't	O
really	O
help	O
.	O


It	O
's	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
,	O


things	O
are	O
going	O
to	O
happen	O
when	O
they	O
happen	O
.	O


But	O
there	O
are	O
ways	O
to	O
help	O
them	O
along	O
.	O


There	O
are	O
ways	O
to	O
help	O
them	O
along	O
.	O


And	O
maybe	O
you	O
're	O
doing	O
them	O


but	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O
.	O


I	O
know	O
you	O
went	O
out	O
with	O
some	O
guy	O
the	O
other	O
night	O
.	O


maybe	O
you	O
are	O
looking	O
actively	O


but	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
see	O
it	O
.	O


So	O
all	O
I	O
can	O
do	O
is	O
sit	O
and	O
worry	O
and	O
be	O
concerned	O


and	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
think	O
Can	O
we	O
talk	O
about	O
the	O
job	O
things	O
now	O
?	O
that	O


Well	O
what	O
about	O
the	O
job	O
things	O
?	O


I	O
ca	O
n't	O
talk	O
about	O
them	O
.	O


I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
anything	O
about	O
them	O
.	O


You	O
want	O
to	O
tell	O
me	O
about	O
them	O
?	O


Well	O
you	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
the	O
job	O
I	O
just	O
took	O
.	O


Now	O
wait	O
a	O
moment	O
.	O


Do	O
n't	O


Well	O
Daddy	O
says	O
they	O
're	O
less	O
important	O
than	O
the	O
other	O
stuff	O


and	O
I	O
agree	O
.	O


But	O
do	O
n't	O
tell	O
me	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
like	O
the	O
job	O
you	O
just	O
took	O
Lizzy	B-PERSON

I	O
do	O
n't	O

enough	O
about	O
it	O

You	O
know	O
I	O
raised	O
you	O


and	O
I	O
thought	O
I	O
was	O


So	O
maybe	O
I	O
can	O
sign	O
ten	O
hours	O
in	O
the	O
school	O
district	O
doing	O
something	O
else	O
.	O


Maybe	O
you	O
can	O

%eh	O
that	O
would	O
be	O
interesting	O
if	O
you	O
know	O
you	O
have	O
hours	O
during	O
the	O

you	O
can	O

really	O
might	O
not	O
be	O

be	O
surprised	O
what	O
people	O
will	O
do	O


Well	O
I	O
w-	O


it	O
's	O
publicity	O


maybe	O
going	O

as	O
a	O
Playboy	B-WORK_OF_ART
model	O


that	O
's	O
right	O

luck	O


can	O
you	O
at	O

go	O
business	O
class	O


I	O
do	O
n't	O
know	O
if	O
I	O
can	O
or	O
not	O


yeah	O


oh	O
by	O
the	O
way	O
you	O
were	O
right	O
with	O
Singapore	B-ORG
Air	I-ORG


it	O
's	O
only	O
business	O
class	O
or	O
first	O
class	O
goes	O
Right	O
miles	O
to	O
frequent	O

Right	O


yeah	O


%um	O
Singapore	B-ORG
Air	I-ORG
takes	O
you	O
around	O
through	O
Europe	B-GPE


they	O
do	O
a	O
route	O
that	O
way	O


yeah	O


yeah	O


that	O
's	O
how	O
they	O
like	O
to	O
go	O


if	O
I	O
you	O
know	O
could	O
have	O
gone	O
specially	O
through	O
Hong	B-GPE
Kong	I-GPE


right	O


but	O
that	O
was	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O
more	O
expensive	O


and	O
they	O
also	O
have	O
connections	O
with	O
Delta	B-ORG


yeah	O


they	O
only	O
give	O
miles	O
on	O
Delta	B-ORG


but	O
you	O
can	O
buy	O
Delta	B-ORG
seats	O
on	O
there	O


right	O


well	O
actually	O
they	O
were	O
going	O
to	O
send	O
me	O
on	O
T	B-FAC
W	I-FAC
A	I-FAC


I	O
almost	O
thought	O
it	O
would	O
be	O
worth	O
it	O
to	O
do	O
that	O
instead	O
of	O
the	O
United	O
because	O
%uh	O
fewer	O
connections	O
instead	O
of	O
connecting	O
in	O
%um	O


%eh	O
well	O
I	O
mean	O
it	O
is	O
a	O
lot	O
further	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
Japan	B-GPE
and	O
all	O
that	O
nonsense	O


but	O
the	O
problem	O
with	O
Singapore	B-ORG
Air	I-ORG
is	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
through	O
New	B-GPE
York	I-GPE
through	O
J	B-FAC
F	I-FAC
K	I-FAC

the	O
international	O
terminal	O


right	O


well	O
T	B-FAC
W	I-FAC
A	I-FAC
is	O
not	O
too	O
bad	O


you	O
have	O
to	O
walk	O
a	O
little	O
bit	O


but	O


yeah	O


no	O


I	O
mean	O
it	O
just	O
yeah	O
it	O
's	O
not	O
saving	O
me	O
much	O
if	O
I	O
have	O
to	O
go	O
through	O
New	B-GPE

through	O
Tokyo	B-GPE

I	O
ca	O
n't	O
just	O

pay	O
an	O
additional	O
little	O
fee	O
.	O


Right	O
.	O


And	O
%um	O
so	O
we	O
're	O
going	O
to	O
like	O
Switzerland	B-GPE
this	B-DATE
weekend	I-DATE


but	O
when	O
we	O
were	O
all	O
just	O
like	O
deciding	O
where	O
we	O
wanted	O
to	O
go	O
the	O
weekend	O
I	O
'm	O
like	O
wow	O
I	O
wish	O
Linda	B-PERSON
and	O
Eric	B-PERSON
we	O
here	O
.	O


I	O
could	O
just	O
pop	O
up	O
to	O
Holland	B-GPE
and	O
see	O
them	O


%ah	O


yeah	O
.	O


Well	O
I	O
'm	O
trying	O
to	O
get	O
things	O
done	O


but	O
Carl	B-PERSON


you	O
know	O
I	O
talked	O
to	O
Carl	B-PERSON
.	O


He	O
's	O
really	O
busy	O


yeah	O


and	O
like	O
the	O
board	O
of	O
directors	O
is	O
very	O
unhappy	O
because	O
our	O
American	B-NORP
business	O
is	O
not	O
doing	O
very	O
well	O


so	O
it	O
's	O
probably	O
like	O
a	O
really	O
bad	O
time	O
for	O
you	O
to	O
be	O
irritating	O
Carl	B-PERSON
about	O
this	O
yeah	O
being	O
the	O
C	O
E	O
O	O
and	O
all	O


yeah	O
.	O


but	O
I	O
called	O
him	O
up	O


and	O
he	O
was	O
like	O
well	O
I	O
can	O
let	O
you	O
know	O


or	O
I	O
'm	O
definitely	O
outgoing	O


like	O
we	O
could	O
definitely	O
go	O


But	O
did	O
I	O
tell	O
you	O
this	O
?	O


He	O
said	O
they	O
might	O
be	O
moving	O
.	O


oh	O
no	O


So	O
that	O
means	O
that	O
they	O
would	O
n't	O
have	O
company	O
housing	O
.	O


Where	O
would	O
they	O
be	O
moving	O
?	O


because	O
they	O
're	O
above	O
a	O
furniture	O
store	O
right	O
now	O
like	O
doing	O
manufacturing	O


so	O


%ah	O


okay	O


He	O
said	O
%um	O
but	O
you	O
know	O
we	O
'd	O
find	O
a	O
place	O
for	O
you	O
because	O
he	O
knows	O
it	O
's	O
totally	O
impossible	O
to	O
find	O
a	O
place	O
in	O
Utrecht	B-GPE


yeah	O

It	O
's	O
like	O
we	O
'll	O

you	O


and	O
we	O
can	O
ta-	O


all	O
I	O
wanted	O
to	O
know	O
All	O
I	O
need	O
to	O

you	O
going	O
to	O
pay	O
me	O
and	O
what	O
are	O
you	O
going	O
to	O
give	O
me	O
in	O
this	O
package	O
?	O


yeah	O
yeah	O

The	O
thing	O
about	O
it	O

the	O

I	O
think	O
that	O
's	O
who	O
runs	O

Well	O
I	O
thought	O


I	O
guess	O
I	O

hour	O
off	O


I	O

and	O
you	O
'd	O

I	O
forget	O
what	O

But	O
I	O
do	O
not	O
remember	O
even	O
one	B-CARDINAL
marriage	O
official	O
who	O
brought	O
up	O
this	O

asking	O
the	O
groom	O
about	O
his	O
lineage	O
before	O
finalizing	O

He	O

such	O

This	O
is	O
a	O
small	O
part	O
of	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
now	O
in	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	I-GPE
,	O
in	O
general	O
,	O
and	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
in	O
Riyadh	B-GPE
,	O
in	O

It	O
reminds	O
me	O
of	O
what	O
used	O
to	O
happen	O
in	O
the	O
city	O
of	O
Cairo	B-GPE
.	O


The	O
bullying	O
,	O
depredation	O
,	O
and	O
theft	O
.	O


But	O
it	O
is	O
notable	O
that	O
the	O
Egyptians	B-NORP
strongly	O
and	O
very	O
quickly	O
eliminated	O
this	O
practice	O
,	O
and	O
our	O
Egyptian	B-NORP
brothers	O
treated	O
the	O
causes	O
,	O
the	O
most	O
important	O
of	O
which	O
is	O
strengthening	O
the	O
security	O
agency	O
and	O
enforcing	O
police	O
members	O
in	O
the	O

and	O

At	O
the	O

time	O
,	O
they	O
know	O
that	O
the	O
continuation	O
of	O
such	O
actions	O
affect	O
the	O
reputation	O
of	O
the	O

,	O
in	O
case	O
they	O

;	O
they	O
would	O

Now	O
,	O
unfortunately	O
,	O
the	O
bullying	O
which	O
was	O
in	O
Cairo	B-GPE
moved	O
to	O
Riyadh	B-GPE
,	O
the	O
capital	O
,	O
which	O
has	O
recently	O
witnessed	O
robberies	O
,	O
kidnappings	O
,	O

....	O
etc.	O


And	O
we	O
are	O
still	O
only	O
watching	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
now	O
;	O
the	O
citizen	O
still	O
faces	O
many	O
problems	O
and	O
robberies	O

The	O
thief	O
had	O
some	O
shyness	O
before	O
and	O
fear	O
of	O
the	O
security	O
forces	O
,	O
but	O
now	O
,	O
there	O
is	O
no	O

They	O
are	O
not	O
ashamed	O
;	O
one	B-CARDINAL
of	O
them	O
steals	O
in	O

of	O
everyone	O
and	O
in	O
the	O
morning	O
,	O
even	O
from	O
a	O
policeman	O
,	O
and	O
this	O
happened	O
in	O
fact	O
.	O


The	O
citizen	O
now	O
,	O
these	O
things	O
which	O
happen	O
now	O
have	O
become	O
normal	O
to	O
him	O
.	O


He	O
is	O
used	O
to	O
them	O
,	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
negligence	O
of	O
security	O
members	O
and	O
their	O
indifference	O
to	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
now	O
,	O
their	O
lack	O
of	O
consideration	O
for	O
the	O

of	O
people	O

their	O

and	O
the	O

that	O
it	O
is	O

go	O
to	O
the	O

to	O
report	O
any	O

violations	O
,	O
though	O
most	O
reports	O
need	O
quick	O

action	O

And	O
because	O
of	O
the	O
complications	O
happening	O
now	O
,	O
the	O
chaos	O
about	O
which	O
we	O
hear	O
and	O
see	O
has	O
prevailed	O

Unfortunately	O
,	O
these	O
things	O
were	O
weak	O
in	O
the	O
beginning	O
,	O
but	O
they	O
have	O
grown	O
now	O
and	O
reached	O
the	O
level	O
they	O
reached	O
because	O
of	O
security	O
weakness	O
and	O
indecisiveness	O
toward	O
such	O

which	O
have	O
become	O
a	O

They	O
happen	O
in	O

If	O
these	O
shameful	O

which	O
are	O
happening	O

our	O

are	O
not	O
treated	O
decisively	O
,	O
we	O
should	O
expect	O
bigger	O
than	O
them	O

The	O
citizen	O
would	O
be	O
forced	O
to	O
own	O
a	O
weapon	O
to	O
protect	O
himself	O
,	O
at	O
the	O
time	O
when	O
the	O

failed	O
to	O

I	O
am	O
talking	O
here	O
about	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
in	O
my	O

and	O
the	O

I	O

what	O

you	O

the	O

on	O
the	O
basis	O
of	O
the	O
following	O
two	B-CARDINAL
reasons	O
:	O


1.	O
Incompetence	O

2.	O
Lack	O
of	O

It	O
mentioned	O
that	O
it	O

on	O
the	O
letter	O
of	O
the	O
governor	O

the	O
area	O
of	O
Riyadh	B-GPE

that	O
it	O

So	O
I	O
traveled	O

this	O

no	O

the	O

This	O

harm	O
my	O
reputation	O
and	O
the	O
integrity	O
of	O
those	O
who	O
issued	O
it	O

and	O
it	O
would	O
weaken	O
the	O
credibility	O
of	O
the	O

they	O

The	O

We	O

We	O
told	O
him	O

Claiming	O
power	O
by	O

silent	O
is	O
something	O
shameful	O
for	O
some	O

is	O

we	O

in	O
this	O

of	O
yours	O

First	B-ORDINAL
-	O
lack	O
of	O
vision	O
:	O


You	O
describe	O
the	O
contemporary	O
Qatari	B-NORP
situation	O
as	O
just	O
a	O
legitimate	O
quest	O
for	O
scientific	O
and	O
technological	O
superiority	O
..	O


If	O
we	O
could	O
agree	O
that	O
we	O
fall	O
behind	O
the	O
Zionists	B-NORP
and	O
Americans	B-NORP
in	O
such	O
fields	O
...	O
however	O
the	O
problem	O
lies	O
in	O
ignoring	O
all	O
this	O
clear	O
evidence	O
that	O
the	O
scientific	O
project	O
is	O
nothing	O
but	O
a	O
small	O
misleading	O
part	O
of	O
a	O
campaign	O
meant	O
to	O
change	O
the	O
Islamic	B-NORP
Gulf	B-LOC
and	O
Qatari	B-NORP
identity	O
and	O
to	O
remove	O
its	O
established	O
fixed	O
principles	O
in	O
which	O
they	O
surpass	O
everything	O
that	O
the	O
Zionists	B-NORP
and	O
the	O
Americans	B-NORP
have	O
.	O


How	O
can	O
you	O
reconcile	O
the	O
will	O
of	O
scientific	O
and	O
technological	O
progress	O
..	O
and	O
hosting	O
the	B-EVENT
Asian	I-EVENT

a	O

a	O
Zionist	B-NORP
politician	O
or	O
a	O
program	O
like	O
the	B-ORG
Doha	I-ORG
Debates	I-ORG
?	O


So	O
...	O
the	O
purely	O
scientific	O
and	O
technological	O
side	O
can	O
not	O
justify	O
what	O
is	O
happening	O
in	O
Qatar	B-GPE

,	O
the	O
contradiction	O

the	O

of	O

interests	O
.	O


In	O
your	O
article	O
here	O
,	O
you	O
justified	O
the	O
legitimacy	O
of	O
hosting	O
Peres	B-PERSON
from	O
the	O
perspective	O
of	O
exchanging	O
opinions	O
,	O
dialogue	O
,	O
and	O
using	O
intellect	O
...	O


Would	O
you	O
have	O
held	O
the	O
same	O
position	O
if	O
a	O
terrorist	O
or	O
a	O
well	O

it	O
if	O

The	O
most	O

That	O

my	O
opinion	O

for	O
you	O

him	O
the	O
issue	O
of	O

and	O
usurping	O
the	O
rights	O
of	O

Or	O
more	O
clearly	O
,	O
you	O
should	O
ask	O
him	O
to	O
explain	O
to	O
you	O
how	O
to	O
hate	O
your	O

maybe	O
he	O
would	O
train	O
you	O

you	O

if	O

the	O

so	O
this	O

out	O

only	O
God	O

whether	O
they	O

Perhaps	O
some	O
of	O
them	O
are	O
Saudi	B-NORP
and	O
some	O
were	O
simply	O
hired	O
to	O
support	O
the	O

In	O
the	O
past	O
,	O
we	O
did	O
not	O
see	O
Saudi	B-NORP
women	O
appear	O
on	O

Then	O
Saudi	B-NORP
women	O
gradually	O
started	O
to	O
appear	O
on	O
Channel	B-ORG
One	I-ORG
,	O
and	O
on	O
the	O
news	O
channel	O
which	O
originally	O
specialized	O
in	O
allowing	O
Saudi	B-NORP
women	O
to	O
appear	O
,	O
and	O
it	O
became	O
commonplace	O

You	O
find	O
them	O
presenting	O

Until	O
the	O
appearance	O
of	O
Saudi	B-NORP
women	O
on	O
our	O
television	O

became	O
a	O
very	O
ordinary	O
thing	O

The	O
problem	O
now	O
is	O
that	O
even	O
women	O
wearing	O
the	O

who	O
are	O
fully	O

The	O

they	O
were	O
the	O

That	O
is	O

the	O
one	B-CARDINAL
who	O
hired	O
them	O

for	O
something	O
in	O

the	O
match	O

That	O

I	O

was	O
one	B-CARDINAL

the	O

of	O
two	B-CARDINAL

The	O
first	B-ORDINAL
:	O
not	O
a	O

The	O
second	B-ORDINAL
:	O
a	O
Saudi	B-NORP

who	O
has	O

up	O

outside	O
Saudi	B-GPE
Arabia	I-GPE
more	O
than	O
she	O
lived	O
inside	O
it	O

I	O
say	O
this	O
because	O
I	O
am	O
a	O
Saudi	B-NORP
and	O
I	O
know	O
well	O
the	O
girls	O
of	O
my	O

No	O

how	O

in	O
the	O

crossed	O
the	O
red	O

This	O
is	O
not	O
done	O
by	O
Saudi	B-NORP
actresses	O
and	O
singers	O
who	O
left	O
the	O
world	O
of	O

a	O

world	O
which	O
suits	O
the	O

It	O
is	O
well	O

are	O
less	O

Has	O

Staffing	O
is	O
very	O
simple	O
;	O
in	O
the	O

many	O
entrepreneurs	O
start	O
from	O

,	O
with	O
one	B-CARDINAL
person	O
handling	O
all	O

Because	O
one	B-CARDINAL

can	O
basically	O
cope	O
with	O
everything	O
in	O
the	O

The	O
risk	O

so	O
if	O
the	O

you	O
do	O
n't	O
need	O
to	O
be	O

Because	O
the	O
initial	O

is	O
low	O
,	O
there	O
are	O
greater	O
opportunities	O
for	O

Therefore	O
the	O

can	O
give	O
up	O
without	O

the	O

a	O

he	O

Then	O
,	O
what	O
surprised	O

?	O


When	O
I	O
saw	O
these	O
six	B-CARDINAL
cachets	O
,	O
my	O
first	B-ORDINAL
reaction	O
is	O
that	O
it	O
is	O
absolutely	O
hopeless	O
to	O
rely	O
on	O
the	O
government	O
itself	O
to	O
control	O
institutional	O

There	O
must	O
be	O
a	O
reason	O
for	O
a	O

Look	O
,	O
I	O
found	O
out	O
the	O
reason	O
for	O
these	O
six	B-CARDINAL
cachets	O
with	O
the	O
slightest	O
effort	O
.	O


However	O
,	O
I	O
am	O
totally	O
an	O
outlier	O
.	O


It	O
is	O
much	O
easier	O
for	O
these	O
governmental	O
departments	O
to	O
find	O
an	O
excuse	O
for	O
their	O
existence	O
,	O
is	O
n't	O
it	O
?	O


And	O
their	O
excuses	O
are	O
always	O
affirmative	O
,	O
and	O
always	O
for	O
the	O
interests	O
of	O
the	O
common	O
people	O
.	O


The	O
existence	O
of	O
governmental	O
departments	O
is	O
different	O
from	O
the	O
existence	O
of	O
private	O
institutions	O
.	O


Private	O
institutions	O
spend	O
their	O
own	O
money	O
,	O
and	O
too	O
much	O
expansion	O
will	O
make	O
them	O
suffer	O

What	O
governmental	O

spend	O
is	O

Regardless	O
how	O
much	O
is	O
spent	O
,	O
as	O
long	O
as	O
the	O
amount	O
is	O
not	O
ridiculously	O
large	O
,	O
they	O
will	O
never	O
face	O
the	O
risk	O
of	O
loss	O
and	O
closing	O
down	O


They	O
themselves	O
can	O
find	O
excuses	O
for	O
thickening	O
without	O
worrying	O
about	O
the	O
problem	O
of	O
money	O
.	O


What	O
kind	O
of	O
excuses	O
governmental	O
institutions	O
have	O
will	O
prevent	O
thickening	O
?	O


I	O
can	O
hardly	O
figure	O
it	O
out	O

Of	O
course	O
,	O
I	O
do	O
n't	O
have	O
any	O
objections	O
against	O
this	O

Metro	B-FAC

so	O
for	O
the	B-DATE
last	I-DATE
thirty	I-DATE

What	O
it	O
does	O
do	O
is	O
allow	O
more	O
people	O
to	O
travel	O
to	O
some	O
places	O
than	O
can	O
be	O
acommodated	O
by	O

It	O
does	O
that	O
by	O
offering	O
a	O

service	O
and	O
less	O

-LRB-	O

It	O
might	O
be	O
that	O
there	O
is	O
still	O
sufficient	O
reason	O
to	O
spend	O
billions	B-MONEY
of	I-MONEY
scarce	I-MONEY

on	O
Metro	O
,	O
but	O
easing	O
traffic	O
congestion	O
is	O
n't	O
one	B-CARDINAL
of	O
them	O
.	O


We	O
should	O
evaluate	O
the	O

for	O
what	O
it	O
does	O
do	O
and	O
who	O

and	O
assign	O

if	O
the	O

is	O

Clearly	O

that	O

Metro	B-FAC
construction	O

Making	O
Route	B-FAC
7	I-FAC

is	O
probably	O
just	O
as	O
bad	O
an	O
idea	O
as	O
Metro	B-FAC
.	O


That	O
is	O
just	O
another	O
plan	O
to	O
take	O
everyone	O
to	O
the	O
same	O
place	O
,	O
which	O
we	O
know	O
will	O
fail	O

The	O
difference	O
is	O
that	O
those	O
who	O
use	O
that	O
route	O
will	O
have	O
individually	O
controlled	O
climate	O

they	O
