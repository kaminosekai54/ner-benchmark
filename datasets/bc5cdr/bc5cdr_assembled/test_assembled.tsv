Famotidine - associated delirium .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Famotidine is a histamine H2-receptor antagonist used in inpatient settings for prevention of stress ulcers and is showing increasing popularity because of its low cost .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Although all of the currently available H2-receptor antagonists have shown the propensity to cause delirium , only two previously reported cases have been associated with famotidine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The authors report on six cases of famotidine - associated delirium in hospitalized patients who cleared completely upon removal of famotidine .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

Indomethacin induced hypotension in sodium and volume depleted rats .	I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
After a single oral dose of 4 mg / kg indomethacin ( IDM ) to sodium and volume depleted rats plasma renin activity ( PRA ) and systolic blood pressure fell significantly within four hours .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In sodium repleted animals indomethacin did not change systolic blood pressure ( BP ) although plasma renin activity was decreased .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thus , indomethacin by inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis may diminish the blood pressure maintaining effect of the stimulated renin - angiotensin system in sodium and volume depletion .	O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O

The objective of this study was to determine the risk of lifetime and current methamphetamine - induced psychosis in patients with methamphetamine dependence .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O
The association between psychiatric co - morbidity and methamphetamine - induced psychosis was also studied .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O
Patients with the diagnosis of methamphetamine based on DSM - IV were interviewed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview ( M.I.N.I. ) for methamphetamine - induced psychosis and other Axis I psychiatric disorders .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Of 292 subjects , 47.9% of the subjects had a past history of psychotic symptoms and 13.0% of the patients were having current psychotic symptoms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Co - morbid major depressive disorder ( OR=7.18 , 95 CI=2.612 - 19.708 ) , bipolar disorder ( OR=13.807 , 95 CI=5.194 - 36.706 ) , antisocial personality disorder ( OR=12.619 , 95 CI=6.702 - 23.759 ) and	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
heavy methamphetamine uses were significantly associated with lifetime methamphetamine - induced psychosis after adjusted for other factors .	O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Major depressive disorder ( OR=2.870 , CI=1.154 - 7.142 ) and antisocial personality disorder ( OR=3.299 , 95 CI=1.375 - 7.914 ) were the only factors associated with current psychosis .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

motor cortical plasticity in Parkinson 's disease :	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
clues from dyskinetic patients .	O O I-Entity O O
The plasticity of primary motor cortex ( M1 ) in patients with Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) and levodopa - induced dyskinesias ( LIDs ) is severely impaired .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
This study demonstrates that the deficient sensorimotor M1 plasticity in 16 patients with LIDs could be reinstated by a single session of real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation but not sham stimulation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The benefit of inhibitory cerebellar stimulation on LIDs is known .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
To explore whether this benefit is linked to the restoration of sensorimotor plasticity of M1 , we conducted an additional study looking at changes in LIDs and PAS - induced plasticity after 10 sessions of either bilateral , real inhibitory cerebellar stimulation or sham stimulation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that alterations in cerebellar sensory processing function , occurring secondary to abnormal basal ganglia signals reaching it , may be an important element contributing to the maladaptive sensorimotor plasticity of M1 and the emergence of abnormal involuntary movements .

The DHEA was administered intraperitoneally ( ip ) for 5 days .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Amphetamine ( 3 mg / kg ip ) induced hyper locomotion , apomorphine ( 1.5 mg / kg	I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
subcutaneously [ sc ] ) induced climbing , and haloperidol ( 1.5 mg / kg sc ) induced catalepsy tests were used as animal models of schizophrenia .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Statistical analysis was carried out using Kruskal - Wallis test for hyper locomotion , and one - way ANOVA for climbing and catalepsy tests .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In the amphetamine - induced locomotion test , there were significant increases in all movements compared with the amphetamine - free group .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Both DHEA 50 mg / kg ( p<0.05 ) , and 100 mg / kg ( p<0.01 ) significantly decreased all movements compared with the amphetamine - induced locomotion group .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
There was a significant difference between groups in the haloperidol - induced catalepsy test ( p<0.05 ) .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
There was no significant difference between groups in terms of total climbing time in the apomorphine - induced climbing test ( p>0.05 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
We observed that DHEA reduced locomotor activity and increased catalepsy at both doses , while it had no effect on climbing behavior .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O

BACKGROUND : S-53482 and S-23121 are N - phenylimide herbicides and produced embryolethality , teratogenicity ( mainly ventricular septal defects and wavy ribs ) , and growth retardation in rats in conventional oral developmental toxicity studies .	O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Our objective in this study was to investigate whether the compounds induce developmental toxicity via the dermal route , which is more relevant to occupational exposure , hence better addressing human health risks .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
S-53482 was administered dermally to rats at 30 , 100 , and 300 mg / kg during organogenesis , and S-23121 was administered at 200 , 400 , and 800 mg / kg ( the maximum applicable dose level ) .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Rates of Renal Toxicity in Cancer Patients	O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O
Receiving Cisplatin	O I-Entity
With and Without Mannitol .	O O O I-Entity O
Cisplatin is a widely used antineoplastic .	I-Entity O O O O O O
One of the major complications of cisplatin use is dose - limiting nephrotoxicity .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
There are many strategies to prevent this toxicity , including the use of mannitol as a nephroprotectant in combination with hydration .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
OBJECTIVE : We aimed to evaluate the rates of cisplatin - induced nephrotoxicity in cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin with and without mannitol .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
This single - center retrospective analysis was a quasi experiment created by the national mannitol shortage .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Data were collected on adult cancer patients receiving single - agent cisplatin as an outpatient from January 2011 to September 2012 .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The primary outcome was acute kidney injury ( AKI ) .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O
We evaluated 143 patients who received single - agent cisplatin ; 97.2% of patients had head and neck cancer as their primary malignancy .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
Patients who did not receive mannitol were more likely to develop nephrotoxicity : odds ratio [ OR ] = 2.646 ( 95% CI = 1.008 , 6.944 ; P = 0.048 ) .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who received the 100 mg / m(2 ) dosing and patients who had a history of hypertension also had a higher likelihood of developing nephrotoxicity : OR = 11.494 ( 95% CI = 4.149 , 32.258 ;	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSIONS : When limited quantities of mannitol are available , it should preferentially be given to patients at particularly high risk of nephrotoxicity .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Our analysis suggests that those patients receiving the dosing schedule of 100 mg / m(2 ) cisplatin every 3 weeks and those with hypertension are at the greatest risk of nephrotoxicity and would benefit from the addition of mannitol .

Cognitive impairment , the most common and severe comorbidity of epilepsy , greatly diminishes the quality of life .	B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
However , current therapeutic interventions for epilepsy can also cause untoward cognitive effects .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Thus , there is an urgent need for new kinds of agents targeting both seizures and cognition deficits .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
Oxidative stress is considered to play an important role in epileptogenesis and cognitive deficits , and antioxidants have a putative antiepileptic potential .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Metformin , the most commonly prescribed antidiabetic oral drug , has antioxidant properties .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study was designed to evaluate the ameliorative effects of metformin on seizures , cognitive impairment and brain oxidative stress markers observed in pentylenetetrazole - induced kindling animals .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Male C57BL/6 mice were administered with subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazole ( 37 mg / kg , i.p . ) every other day for 14 injections .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Metformin was injected intraperitoneally in dose of 200mg /	I-Entity O O O O O O O O

We found that metformin suppressed the progression of kindling , ameliorated the cognitive impairment and decreased brain oxidative stress .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
Thus the present study concluded that metformin may be a potential agent for the treatment of epilepsy as well as a protective medicine against cognitive impairment induced by seizures .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O
P53 inhibition exacerbates late - stage anthracycline cardiotoxicity .	O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O
AIMS : Doxorubicin ( DOX ) is an effective anti - cancer therapeutic , but is associated with both acute and late - stage cardiotoxicity .	O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Children are particularly sensitive to DOX - induced heart failure .	O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Here , the impact of p53 inhibition on acute vs. late - stage DOX cardiotoxicity was examined in a juvenile model .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
littermates received weekly DOX injections for 5 weeks ( 25 mg / kg cumulative dose ) .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One week after the last DOX treatment ( acute stage ) , MHC - CB7 mice exhibited improved cardiac function and lower levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with the NON - TXG mice .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Surprisingly , by 13 weeks following the last DOX treatment ( late stage ) , MHC - CB7 exhibited a progressive decrease in cardiac function and higher rates of cardiomyocyte apoptosis when compared with NON - TXG mice .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
p53 inhibition blocked transient DOX - induced STAT3 activation in MHC - CB7 mice , which was associated with enhanced induction of the DNA repair proteins Ku70 and Ku80 .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Mice with cardiomyocyte - restricted deletion of STAT3 exhibited worse cardiac function , higher levels of cardiomyocyte apoptosis , and a greater induction of Ku70 and Ku80 in response to DOX treatment during the acute stage when compared with control animals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION : These data support a model wherein a p53-dependent cardioprotective pathway , mediated via STAT3 activation , mitigates DOX - induced myocardial stress during drug delivery .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , these data suggest an explanation as to how p53 inhibition can result in cardioprotection during drug treatment and , paradoxically , enhanced cardiotoxicity long after the cessation of drug treatment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Aconitine - induced Ca2 + overload causes arrhythmia and triggers apoptosis through p38 MAPK signaling pathway in rats .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Aconitine is a major bioactive diterpenoid alkaloid with high content derived from herbal aconitum plants .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Emerging evidence indicates that voltage - dependent Na(+ ) channels have pivotal roles in the cardiotoxicity of aconitine .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
However , no reports are available on the role of Ca(2 + ) in aconitine poisoning .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity I-Entity O
In this study , we explored the importance of pathological Ca(2 + ) signaling in aconitine poisoning in vitro and in vivo .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
We found that Ca(2 + ) overload lead to accelerated beating rhythm in adult rat ventricular myocytes and caused arrhythmia in conscious freely moving rats .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
To investigate effects of aconitine on myocardial injury , we performed cytotoxicity assay in neonatal rat ventricular myocytes ( NRVMs ) , as well as measured lactate dehydrogenase level in the culture medium of NRVMs and activities of serum cardiac enzymes in rats .	O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The results showed that aconitine resulted in myocardial injury and reduced NRVMs viability dose - dependently .	O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
transferase - mediated dUTP - biotin nick end labeling assay .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
The results showed that aconitine stimulated apoptosis time - dependently .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
The expression analysis of Ca(2 + )	O O O O I-Entity O O
handling proteins demonstrated that aconitine promoted Ca(2 + ) overload through the expression regulation of Ca(2 + ) handling proteins .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Hence , our results suggest that aconitine significantly aggravates Ca(2 + ) overload and causes arrhythmia and finally promotes apoptotic development via phosphorylation of P38 mitogen - activated protein kinase .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

However , there is no research on GFC effects in the central nervous system of rodents .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
The present study aimed to evaluate the GFC effects at doses of 25 , 50 or 75 mg / kg on seizure parameters to determine their anticonvulsant activity and its effects on amino acid ( r - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) , glutamine , aspartate and glutathione ) levels as well as on acetylcholinesterase ( AChE ) activity in mice hippocampus after seizures .

One month after starting the antiviral therapy , the patient was admitted to the hospital because he developed rhabdomyolysis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
At admission simvastatin and all antiviral drugs were discontinued because toxicity due to a drug - drug interaction was suspected .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The creatine kinase peaked at 62,246 IU / L and the patient was treated with intravenous normal saline .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fourteen days after hospitalization , creatine kinase level had returned to 230 IU / L and the patient was discharged .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Telaprevir was considered the probable causative agent of an interaction with simvastatin according to the Drug Interaction Probability Scale .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The interaction is due to inhibition of CYP3A4-mediated simvastatin clearance .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O

The kinin B2 receptor has been associated with the inflammation process , as well as the regulation of cytokine expression , and its deletion resulted in an improvement in the diabetic nephropathy status .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O
To examine the role of the kinin B2 receptor in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury , kinin B2 receptor knockout mice were challenged with cisplatin .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Additionally , WT mice were treated with a B2 receptor antagonist after cisplatin administration .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
B2 receptor - deficient mice were less sensitive to this drug than the WT mice , as shown by reduced weight loss , better preservation of kidney function , down regulation of inflammatory cytokines and less acute tubular necrosis .

Moreover , treatment with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist effectively reduced the levels of serum creatinine and blood urea after cisplatin administration .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
Thus , our data suggest that the kinin B2 receptor is involved in cisplatin - induced acute kidney injury by mediating the necrotic process and the expression of inflammatory cytokines , thus resulting in declined renal function .

We also analyzed published and unpublished follow - up data to determine the risk of ICH in antithrombotic users with MB .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
In a pooled analysis of 1460 ICH and 3817 IS / TIA , MB were more frequent in ICH vs	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
IS / TIA in all treatment groups , but the excess increased from 2.8 ( odds ratio ; range , 2.3 - 3.5 ) in nonantithrombotic users to 5.7 ( range , 3.4 - 9.7 ) in antiplatelet users and 8.0 ( range , 3.5 - 17.8 ) in warfarin users ( P difference=0.01 ) .

Verapamil stimulation test in hyperprolactinemia : loss of prolactin response in anatomic or functional stalk effect .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Verapamil stimulation test was previously investigated as a tool for differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia , but with conflicting results .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Macroprolactinemia was never considered in those previous studies .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Here , we aimed to re - investigate the diagnostic value of verapamil in a population who were all screened for macroprolactinemia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Prolactin responses to verapamil in 65 female patients ( age : 29.9 + /-	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O

Verapamil responsiveness was determined by peak percent change in basal prolactin levels ( PRL ) .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Verapamil significantly increased PRL levels in healthy controls ( N. 8 , PRL : 183% ) , macroprolactinoma ( N. 8 , PRL : 7% ) , microprolactinoma ( N. 19 , PRL : 21% ) , macroprolactinemia	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity

CONCLUSION : Verapamil responsiveness is not a reliable finding for the differential diagnosis of hyperprolactinemia .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
However , verapamil unresponsiveness discriminates stalk effect ( i.e. , anatomically or functionally inhibited dopaminergic tonus ) from other causes of hyperprolactinemia with varying degrees of responsiveness .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O

The biochemical assays on the influence of four analgesics on the brain concentration and turnover of noradrenaline ( NA ) were also performed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
It was found that three drugs stimulating central NA receptors failed to affect the analgesic ED50 of all antinociceptive agents and they enhanced catalepsy induced by morphine and fentanyl .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Codeine catalepsy was increased by clonidine and decreased by naphazoline and xylometazoline .	I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
The brain concentration of NA was not changed by morphine and fentanyl , but one of the doses of codeine ( 45 mg / kg ) slightly enhanced it .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Pentazocine dose - dependently decreased the brain level of NA .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The rate of NA turnover was not altered by analgesics except for the higher dose of fentanyl ( 0.2 mg / kg ) following which the disappearance of NA from the brain was diminished .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
It is suggested that in rats the brain NA plays a less important function than the other monoamines in the behavioural activity of potent analgesics .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Effective topical antimicrobial agents decrease infection and mortality in burn patients .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O
Chlorhexidine phosphanilate ( CHP ) , a new broad - spectrum antimicrobial agent , has been evaluated as a topical burn wound dressing in cream form , but preliminary clinical trials reported that it was painful upon application .	B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study compared various concentrations of CHP to determine if a tolerable concentration could be identified with retention of antimicrobial efficacy .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Twenty - nine burn patients , each with two similar burns which could be separately treated , were given pairs of treatments at successive 12-h intervals over a 3-day period .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
One burn site was treated with each of four different CHP concentrations , from 0.25 per cent to 2 per cent , their vehicle , and 1 per cent silver sulphadiazine ( AgSD ) cream , an antimicrobial agent frequently used for topical treatment of burn wounds .

Busulfan is known to be neurotoxic in animals and humans , but its acute neurotoxicity remains poorly characterized in children .	I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
We report here a retrospective study of 123 children ( median age , 6.5 years ) receiving high - dose busulfan in combined chemotherapy before bone marrow transplantation for malignant solid tumors , brain tumors excluded .

Busulfan was given p.o .	I-Entity O O O O
Ninety - six patients were not given anticonvulsive prophylaxis ; 7 ( 7.5% ) developed seizures during the 4 days of the busulfan course or within 24 h after the last dosing .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
When the total busulfan dose was taken into account , there was a significant difference in terms of neurotoxicity incidence among patients under 16 mg / kg ( 1 of 57 , 1.7% ) and patients under 600 mg / m2 ( 6 of 39 , 15.4% ) ( P less than 0.02 ) .

Since plasma pharmacokinetic studies showed a faster busulfan clearance in children than in adults , this new dose may approximate more closely the adult systemic exposure obtained after the usual 16-mg / kg total dose , with potential inferences in terms of anticancer or myeloablative effects .

Anticonvulsant actions of MK-801 on the lithium - pilocarpine model of status epilepticus in rats .	O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
MK-801 , a noncompetitive N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , was tested for anticonvulsant effects in rats using two seizure models , coadministration of lithium and pilocarpine and administration of a high dose of pilocarpine alone .

First , pretreatment with MK-801 produced an effective and dose - dependent anticonvulsant action with the lithium - pilocarpine model but not with rats treated with pilocarpine alone , suggesting that different biochemical mechanisms control seizures in these two models .

Second , the anticonvulsant effect of MK-801 in the lithium - pilocarpine model only occurred after initial periods of seizure activity .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
This observation is suggested to be an in vivo demonstration of the conclusion derived from in vitro experiments that MK-801 binding requires agonist - induced opening of the channel sites of the NMDA receptor .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Third , although it is relatively easy to block seizures induced by lithium and pilocarpine by administration of anticonvulsants prior to pilocarpine , it is more difficult to terminate ongoing status epilepticus and block the lethality of the seizures .

Administration of MK-801 30 or 60 min after pilocarpine , i.e. , during status epilepticus , gradually reduced electrical and behavioral seizure activity and greatly enhanced the survival rate .	O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Sprague - Dawley rats that were 20 days pregnant and nonpregnant rats of the same age and strain received infusions of aminophylline until onset of maximal seizures which occurred after 28 and 30 minutes respectively .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Theophylline concentrations at this endpoint in serum ( total ) and CSF were similar but serum ( free ) and brain concentrations were slightly different in pregnant rats .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Theophylline serum protein binding determined by equilibrium dialysis was lower in pregnant rats .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Fetal serum concentrations at onset of seizures in the mother were similar to maternal brain and CSF concentrations and correlated significantly with the former .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It is concluded that advanced pregnancy has a negligible effect on the neurotoxic response to theophylline in rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Hyperkalemia induced by indomethacin and naproxen and reversed by fludrocortisone .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
We have described a patient with severe rheumatoid arthritis and a history of mefenamic acid nephropathy in whom hyperkalemia and inappropriate hypoaldosteronism were caused by both indomethacin and naproxen , without major decline in renal function .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
It is likely that preexisting renal disease predisposed this patient to type IV renal tubular acidosis with prostaglandin synthetase inhibitors .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O
Because he was unable to discontinue nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug therapy , fludrocortisone was added , correcting the hyperkalemia and allowing indomethacin therapy to be continued safely .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Hypotension as a manifestation of cardiotoxicity in three patients receiving cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil .	I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Cardiac symptoms , including hypotension , developed in three patients with advanced colorectal carcinoma while being treated with cisplatin ( CDDP ) and 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
In two patients , hypotension was associated with severe left ventricular dysfunction .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
The presentation and cardiac evaluation ( hemodynamic , echocardiographic , and scintigraphic ) of these patients suggest new manifestations of 5-FU cardiotoxicity that may be influenced by CDDP .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
Fatal aplastic anemia in a patient treated with carbamazepine .	O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
A case of fatal aplastic anemia due to carbamazepine treatment in an epileptic woman is reported .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O
Despite concerns of fatal bone marrow toxicity due to carbamazepine , this is only the fourth documented and published report .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Carbamazepine is a safe drug , but physicians and patients should be aware of the exceedingly rare but potentially fatal side effects , better prevented by clinical than by laboratory monitoring .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Participation of a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway in the rat brain in clonidine - induced hypotension and bradycardia .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
The effects of microinjection of clonidine ( 1 - 10 micrograms in 1 microliter ) into a region adjacent to the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata on cardiovascular function were assessed in urethane - anesthetized rats .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Intramedullary administration of clonidine , but not saline vehicle , caused a dose - dependent decrease in both the mean arterial pressure and the heart rate .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The clonidine - induced hypotension was antagonized by prior spinal transection , but not bilateral vagotomy .	O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
On the other hand , the clonidine - induced bradycardia was antagonized by prior bilateral vagotomy , but not spinal transection .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Furthermore , selective destruction of the spinal 5-HT nerves , produced by bilateral spinal injection of 5,7-dihydroxytryptamine , reduced the magnitude of the vasodepressor or the bradycardiac responses to clonidine microinjected into the area near the ventrolateral surface of the medulla oblongata in rats .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The data indicate that a bulbospinal serotonergic pathway is involved in development of clonidine - induced hypotension and bradycardia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
The induced hypotension is brought about by a decrease in sympathetic efferent activity , whereas the induced bradycardia was due to an increase in vagal efferent activity .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Hypertension in neuroblastoma induced by imipramine .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Hypertension is a well - known finding in some patients with neuroblastoma .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
However , it has not previously been described in association with the use of Imipramine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
We report the occurrence of severe hypertension ( blood pressure 190/160 ) in a 4-year - old girl with neuroblastoma who was given Imipramine to control a behavior disorder .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
It was determined later that this patient 's tumor was recurring at the time of her hypertensive episode .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Since she had no blood pressure elevation at initial diagnosis and none following discontinuation of the Imipramine ( when she was in florid relapse ) , we believe that this drug rather than her underlying disease alone caused her hypertension .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The mechanism for this reaction is believed to be increased levels of vasoactive catecholamines due to interference of their physiologic inactivation by Imipramine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
From this experience , we urge extreme caution in the use of tricyclic antidepressants in children with active neuroblastoma .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Rechallenge of patients who developed oral candidiasis or hoarseness with beclomethasone dipropionate .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
Of 158 asthmatic patients who were placed on inhaled beclomethasone , 15 ( 9.5% ) developed either hoarseness ( 8) , oral thrush ( 6 ) , or both ( 1 ) .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
When their adverse reactions subsided , seven of these 15 patients were rechallenged with inhaled beclomethasone .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
These included five cases who developed hoarseness and three who developed Candidiasis .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
Oral thrush did not recur , but 60% ( 3/5 ) of patients with hoarseness had recurrence .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
We conclude that patients may be restarted on inhaled beclomethasone when clinically indicated ; however , because of the high recurrence rate , patients who develop hoarseness should not be re - challenged .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Concomitant use of oral prednisone and topical beclomethasone may increase the risk of developing hoarseness or candidiasis .	O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Cyclophosphamide cardiotoxicity : an analysis of dosing as a risk factor .	I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Patients who undergo bone marrow transplantation are generally immunosuppressed with a dose of cyclophosphamide ( CYA ) which is usually calculated based on the patient 's weight .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
At these high doses of CYA , serious cardiotoxicity may occur , but definitive risk factors for the development of such cardiotoxicity have not been described .	O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Since chemotherapeutic agent toxicity generally correlates with dose per body surface area , we retrospectively calculated the dose of CYA in patients transplanted at our institution to determine whether the incidence of CYA cardiotoxicity correlated with the dose per body surface area .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Eighty patients who were to receive CYA 50 mg / kg / d for four days as preparation for marrow grafting underwent a total of 84 transplants for aplastic anemia , Wiskott - Aldrich syndrome , or severe combined immunodeficiency syndrome .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Fourteen of 84 ( 17% ) patients had symptoms and signs consistent with CYA cardiotoxicity within ten days of receiving 1 to 4 doses of CYA .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Six of the 14 patients died with congestive heart failure .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
The dose of CYA per body surface area was calculated for all patients and the patients were divided into two groups based on daily CYA dose : Group 1 , CYA less than or equal to 1.55 g / m2/d ; Group 2 , CYA greater than 1.55	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Cardiotoxicity that was thought to be related to CYA occurred in 1/32 ( 3% ) of patients in Group 1 and in 13/52 ( 25% ) patients in Group 2 ( P less than 0.025 ) .	I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Congestive heart failure caused or contributed to death in 0/32 patients in Group 1 v 6/52 ( 12% ) of patients in Group 2 ( P less than 0.25 ) .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We conclude that the CYA cardiotoxicity correlates with CYA dosage as calculated by body surface area , and that patients with aplastic anemia and immunodeficiencies can be effectively prepared for bone marrow grafting at a CYA dose of 1.55 g / m2/d for four days with a lower incidence of cardiotoxicity than patients whose CYA dosage is calculated based on weight .

Studies of risk factors for aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity .	O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O
The epidemiology of aminoglycoside - induced nephrotoxicity is not fully understood .	O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
Experimental studies in healthy human volunteers indicate aminoglycosides cause proximal tubular damage in most patients , but rarely , if ever , cause glomerular or tubular dysfunction .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Clinical trials of aminoglycosides in seriously ill patients indicate that the relative risk for developing acute renal failure during therapy ranges from 8 to 10 and that the attributable risk is 70% to 80% .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Further analysis of these data suggests that the duration of therapy , plasma aminoglycoside levels , liver disease , advanced age , high initial estimated creatinine clearance and , possibly , female gender all increase the risk for nephrotoxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Other causes of acute renal failure , such as shock , appear to have an additive effect .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Flurothyl seizure thresholds in mice treated neonatally with a single injection of monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) : evaluation of experimental parameters in flurothyl seizure testing .	I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O
Monosodium glutamate ( MSG ) administration to neonatal rodents produces convulsions and results in numerous biochemical and behavioral deficits .	B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
These studies were undertaken to determine if neonatal administration of MSG produced permanent alterations in seizure susceptibility , since previous investigations were inconclusive .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
A flurothyl ether seizure screening technique was used to evaluate seizure susceptibility in adult mice that received neonatal injections of MSG ( 4 mg / g and 1 mg / g ) .	O I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
MSG treatment resulted in significant reductions in whole brain weight but did not alter seizure threshold .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
A naloxone ( 5 mg / kg ) challenge was also ineffective in altering the seizure thresholds of either control of MSG - treated mice .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Flurothyl ether produced hypothermia which was correlated with the duration of flurothyl exposure ; however , the relationship of hypothermia to seizure induction was unclear .	I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O

Electroencephalographic and behavioral monitoring revealed a profound reduction of the threshold for pilocarpine - induced convulsions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Morphological analysis of frontal forebrain sections with light microscopy revealed seizure - related damage to the hippocampal formation , thalamus , amygdala , olfactory cortex , substantia nigra and neocortex , which is typically observed with pilocarpine in doses exceeding 350 mg / kg .

Bilateral intrastriatal injections of isoniazid did not augment seizures produced by pilocarpine , 200 mg / kg .	O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Application of an irreversible inhibitor of GABA transaminase , gamma - vinyl - GABA ( D , L-4-amino - hex-5-enoic acid ) , 5 micrograms , into the SNR , bilaterally , suppressed the appearance of electrographic and behavioral seizures produced by pilocarpine , 380 mg / kg .

For individual patients , there were no obvious differences between the body surface distribution of ST depression in both tests .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
The increase in pressure rate product after dipyridamole was significantly less than that during the treadmill exercise .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O

Lidocaine , given in a 300 mg dose intramuscularly followed by 100 mg intravenously , did not prevent sustained ventricular tachycardia , although there was a significant reduction in the number of patients with warning arrhythmias between 15 and 45 minutes after the administration of lidocaine ( p less than 0.05 ) .

Evidence for a cholinergic role in haloperidol - induced catalepsy .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Experiments in mice tested previous evidence that activation of cholinergic systems promotes catalepsy and that cholinergic mechanisms need to be intact for full expression of neuroleptic - induced catalepsy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Large doses of the cholinomimetic , pilocarpine , could induce catalepsy when peripheral cholinergic receptors were blocked .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Low doses of pilocarpine caused a pronounced enhancement of the catalepsy that was induced by the dopaminergic blocker , haloperidol .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
A muscarinic receptor blocker , atropine , disrupted haloperidol - induced catalepsy .	O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Intracranial injection of an acetylcholine - synthesis inhibitor , hemicholinium , prevented the catalepsy that is usually induced by haloperidol .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O

Cardiovascular dysfunction and hypersensitivity to sodium pentobarbital induced by chronic barium chloride ingestion .	B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O
Barium - supplemented Long - Evans hooded rats were characterized by a persistent hypertension that was evident after 1 month of barium ( 100 micrograms / ml mineral fortified water ) treatment .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
myocardial excitability , contractility , and metabolic characteristics at 16 months revealed other significant barium - induced disturbances within the cardiovascular system .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
The most distinctive aspect of the barium effect was a demonstrated hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Under barbiturate anesthesia , virtually all of the myocardial contractile indices were depressed significantly in barium - exposed rats relative to the corresponding control - fed rats .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
The lack of a similar response to ketamine and xylazine anesthesia revealed that the cardiovascular actions of sodium pentobarbital in barium - treated rats were linked specifically to this anesthetic , and were not representative of a generalized anesthetic response .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Other myocardial pathophysiologic and metabolic changes induced by barium were manifest , irrespective of the anesthetic employed .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
The contractile element shortening velocity of the cardiac muscle fibers was significantly slower in both groups of barium - treated rats relative to the control groups , irrespective of the anesthetic regimen .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Similarly , significant disturbances in myocardial energy metabolism were detected in the barium - exposed rats which were consistent with the reduced contractile element shortening velocity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In addition , the excitability of the cardiac conduction system was depressed preferentially in the atrioventricular nodal region of hearts from barium - exposed rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Overall , the altered cardiac contractility and excitability characteristics , the myocardial metabolic disturbances , and the hypersensitivity of the cardiovascular system to sodium pentobarbital suggest the existence of a heretofore undescribed cardiomyopathic disorder induced by chronic barium exposure .

Propranolol antagonism of phenylpropanolamine - induced hypertension .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Phenylpropanolamine ( PPA ) overdose can cause severe hypertension , intracerebral hemorrhage , and death .	I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
We studied the efficacy and safety of propranolol in the treatment of PPA - induced hypertension .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Subjects received propranolol either by mouth for 48 hours before PPA or as a rapid intravenous infusion after PPA .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
PPA , 75 mg alone , increased blood pressure ( 31 + /-	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O

Intravenous propranolol after PPA also decreased blood pressure .	O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
Left ventricular function ( assessed by echocardiography ) showed that PPA increased the stroke volume 30% ( from 62.5 + /-	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Intravenous propranolol reversed these effects .	O I-Entity O O O O
Systemic vascular resistance was increased by PPA 28% ( from 1710 + /-	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
sec / cm5 ) and was further increased by propranolol 22% ( to 2660 + /-	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
We conclude that PPA increases blood pressure by increasing systemic vascular resistance and cardiac output , and that propranolol antagonizes this increase by reversing the effect of PPA on cardiac output .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
That propranolol antagonizes the pressor effect of PPA is in contrast to the interaction in which propranolol enhances the pressor effect of norepinephrine .	O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
This is probably because PPA has less beta 2 activity than does norepinephrine .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O

At 5 months glomerular sclerosis was found in 7.6 + /-	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
3.4% of the glomeruli of PAN rats ; glomeruli of the controls were normal .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O

Glomeruli with sclerosis contained significantly more CC than non - sclerotic glomeruli in the same kidneys .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Since mesangial CC clearance from the mesangium did not change during chronic PAN treatment , we conclude that this preferential CC localization within the lesions is caused by an increased CC uptake shortly after injection in apparent vulnerable areas where sclerosis will develop subsequently .

Relationship between nicotine - induced seizures and hippocampal nicotinic receptors .	O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O

Mice sensitive to the convulsant effects of nicotine had greater alpha - bungarotoxin binding in the hippocampus than seizure insensitive mice .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
The binding sites from seizure sensitive and resistant mice were equally affected by treatment with dithiothreitol , trypsin or heat .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
Thus it appears that the difference between seizure sensitive and insensitive animals may be due to a difference in hippocampal nicotinic receptor concentration as measured with alpha - bungarotoxin binding .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Acetaminophen ( APAP ) produces proximal tubular necrosis in Fischer 344 ( F344 ) rats .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Recently , p - aminophenol ( PAP ) , a known potent nephrotoxicant , was identified as a metabolite of APAP in F344 rats .	O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
The purpose of this study was to determine if PAP formation is a requisite step in APAP - induced nephrotoxicity .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Therefore , the effect of bis(p - nitrophenyl ) phosphate ( BNPP ) , an acylamidase inhibitor , on APAP and PAP nephrotoxicity and metabolism was determined .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
BNPP ( 1 to 8 mM ) reduced APAP deacetylation and covalent binding in F344 renal cortical homogenates in a concentration - dependent manner .	I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pretreatment of animals with BNPP prior to APAP or PAP administration resulted in marked reduction of APAP ( 900 mg / kg )	O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
nephrotoxicity but not PAP nephrotoxicity .	I-Entity O O I-Entity I-Entity O
This result was not due to altered disposition of either APAP or acetylated metabolites in plasma or renal cortical and hepatic tissue .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Rather , BNPP pretreatment reduced the fraction of APAP excreted as PAP by 64 and 75% after APAP doses of 750 and 900 mg / kg .	O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
BNPP did not alter the excretion of APAP or any of its non - deacetylated metabolites nor did BNPP alter excretion of PAP or its metabolites after PAP doses of 150 and 300 mg / kg .	I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Therefore , the BNPP - induced reduction in APAP - induced nephrotoxicity appears to be due to inhibition of APAP deacetylation .	O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
It is concluded that PAP formation , in vivo , accounts , at least in part , for APAP - induced renal tubular necrosis .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O

These data are consistent with the hypothesis that exercise - induced tachycardia results largely from beta 1-receptor activation that is blocked by both cardioselective and nonselective drugs , whereas isoproterenol activates both beta 1- and beta 2-receptors so that after cardioselective blockade there remains a beta 2-component that can be blocked with a nonselective drug .

Vasopressin as a possible contributor to hypertension .	I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
The role of vasopressin as a pressor agent to the hypertensive process was examined .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Vasopressin plays a major role in the pathogenesis of DOCA - salt hypertension , since the elevation of blood pressure was not substantial in the rats with lithium - treated diabetes insipidus after DOCA - salt treatment .

Increased secretion of vasopressin from neurohypophysis also promotes the function of the hormone as a pathogenetic factor in hypertension .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
An unproportional release of vasopressin compared to plasma osmolality may be induced by the absence of an adjusting control of angiotensin II forming and receptor binding capacity for sodium balance in the brain .

Both timolol and pilocarpine were subsequently identified in a 24-h collection of urine .	O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Timolol ( but not pilocarpine ) was detected in a sample of plasma removed during surgery ; the plasma concentration of timolol ( 2.6 ng ml-1 ) was consistent with partial beta - adrenoceptor blockade .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Superoxide dismutase ( SOD ) or dimethylthiourea ( DMTU ) significantly lessened the GM - induced decrement in CIn .	I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
The SOD - induced increase in glomerular filtration rate was associated with a marked improvement in RBF , an increase in urinary cGMP excretion , and a decrease in renal renin and endothelin-1 content .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
SOD did not attenuate the tubular damage .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

We investigated the effects of clentiazem , a 1,5-benzothiazepine calcium antagonist , on epinephrine - induced cardiomyopathy in rats .	O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
With 2-week chronic epinephrine infusion , 16 of 30 rats died within 4 days , and severe ischemic lesions and fibrosis of the left ventricles were observed .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Treatment with clentiazem prevented epinephrine - induced death ( P <	O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O

Left atrial and left ventricular papillary muscle contractile responses to isoproterenol were reduced compared to controls in groups treated with clentiazem alone , but combined with epinephrine , clentiazem restored left atrial responses and enhanced left ventricular papillary responses to isoproterenol .

We therefore examined whether bupivacaine alters the dysrhythmogenicity of subsequent administration of epinephrine in conscious , healthy dogs and in anesthetized dogs with myocardial infarction .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O

In the bupivacaine groups , epinephrine caused fewer prodysrhythmic effects than without bupivacaine .	O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O
VT appeared in fewer dogs and at a later time , and there were more sinoatrial beats and less ectopies .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

In these dogs , the prodysrhythmic response to epinephrine was also mitigated by preceding bupivacaine .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O

In rats with PAN nephropathy , administration of rhIGF - I increased IGF - I and GH receptor gene expression , without altering the steady state level of IGF - I receptor mRNA .	O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In normal rats with intact kidneys , rhIGF - I administration ( n = 4 ) did not alter weight gain , blood pressure , proteinuria , GFR , glomerular planar area , renal cortical malondialdehyde content , or glomerular or tubulointerstitial damage , compared with untreated animals ( n = 4 ) .

Nefiracetam ( DM-9384 ) reverses apomorphine - induced amnesia of a passive avoidance response :	I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Nefiracetam is a novel pyrrolidone derivative which attenuates scopolamine - induced learning and post - training consolidation deficits .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Given that apomorphine inhibits passive avoidance retention when given during training or in a defined 10 - 12h post - training period , we evaluated the ability of nefiracetam to attenuate amnesia induced by dopaminergic agonism .

A step - down passive avoidance paradigm was employed and nefiracetam ( 3 mg / kg ) and apomorphine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) were given alone or in combination during training and at the 10 - 12h post - training period of consolidation .

These effects were not mediated by a dopaminergic mechanism as nefiracetam , at millimolar concentrations , failed to displace either [ 3H]SCH 23390 or [ 3H]spiperone binding from D1 or D2 dopamine receptor subtypes , respectively .

Population - based study of risk of venous thromboembolism associated with various oral contraceptives .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
BACKGROUND : Four studies published since December , 1995 , reported that the incidence of venous thromboembolism ( VTE ) was higher in women who used oral contraceptives ( OCs ) containing the third - generation progestagens gestodene or desogestrel than in users of OCs containing second - generation progestagens .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
The aim of our study was to re - examine the association between risk of VTE and OC use with a different study design and analysis to avoid some of the bias and confounding of the earlier studies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All women who had a recorded diagnosis of deep - vein thrombosis , venous thrombosis not otherwise specified , or pulmonary embolus during the study period , and who had been treated with an anticoagulant were identified as potential cases of VTE .	O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
We did a cohort analysis to estimate and compare incidence of VTE in users of the main OC preparations , and a nested case - control study to calculate the odds ratios of VTE associated with use of different types of OC , after adjustment for potential confounding factors .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
In the case - control study , we matched cases to controls by exact year of birth , practice , and current use of OCs .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
We used a multiple logistic regression model that included body - mass index , number of cycles , change in type of OC prescribed within 3 months of the event , previous pregnancy , and concurrent disease .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
FINDINGS : 85 women met the inclusion criteria for VTE , two of whom were users of progestagen - only OCs .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Of the 83 cases of VTE associated with use of combined OCs , 43 were recorded as deep - vein thrombosis , 35 as pulmonary thrombosis , and five as venous thrombosis not otherwise specified .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
The crude rate of VTE per 10,000 woman - years was 4.10 in current users of any OC , 3.10 in users of second - generation OCs , and 4.96 in users of third - generation preparations .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
After adjustment for age , the rate ratio of VTE in users of third - generation relative to second - generation OCs was 1.68 ( 95% CI 1.04 - 2.75 ) .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Logistic regression showed no significant difference in the risk of VTE between users of third - generation and second - generation OCs .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Among users of third - generation progestagens , the risk of VTE was higher in users of desogestrel with 20 g ethinyloestradiol than in users of gestodene or desogestrel with 30 g ethinyloestradiol .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
With all second - generation OCs as the reference , the odds ratios for VTE were 3.49 ( 1.21 - 10.12 ) for desogestrel plus 20 g ethinyloestradiol and 1.18 ( 0.66 - 2.17 ) for the other third - generation progestagens .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The previously reported increase in odds ratio associated with third - generation OCs when compared with second - generation products is likely to have been the result of residual confounding by age .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The increased odds ratio associated with products containing 20 micrograms ethinyloestradiol and desogestrel compared with the 30 micrograms product is biologically implausible , and is likely to be the result of preferential prescribing and , thus , confounding .

OBJECTIVE : We wanted to test whether assessment of both a central pain - related signal ( chemo - somatosensory evoked potential , CSSEP ) and a concomitantly recorded peripheral signal ( negative mucosal potential , NMP ) allows for separation of central and peripheral effects of NSAIDs .

For this purpose , experimental conditions were created in which NSAIDs had previously been observed to produce effects on phasic and tonic pain by either central or peripheral mechanisms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
According to a double - blind , randomised , controlled , threefold cross - over design , 18 healthy subjects ( 11 males , 7 females ; mean age 26 years ) received either placebo , 400 mg ibuprofen , or 800 mg ibuprofen .

Phasic pain was applied by means of short pulses of CO2 to the nasal mucosa ( stimulus duration 500 ms , interval approximately 60 s ) , and tonic pain was induced in the nasal cavity by means of dry air of controlled temperature , humidity and flow rate ( 22 degrees C , 0% relative humidity , 145 ml.s-1 ) .

Both CSSEPs as central and NMPs as peripheral correlates of pain were obtained in response to the CO2 stimuli .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Additionally , the subjects rated the intensity of both phasic and tonic pain by means of visual analogue scales .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
As described earlier , administration of ibuprofen was followed by a decrease in tonic pain but - relative to placebo - an increase in correlates of phasic pain , indicating a specific effect of ibuprofen on the interaction between the pain stimuli under these special experimental conditions .

Recently , fenfluramine appetite suppressants became widely used in the United States but were withdrawn in September 1997 because of concerns over adverse effects .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
: We conducted a prospective surveillance study on patients diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension at 12 large referral centers in North America .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Data collected on patients seen from September 1 , 1996 , to December 31 , 1997 , included the cause of the pulmonary hypertension and its severity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Patients with no identifiable cause of pulmonary hypertension were classed as PPH .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
A history of drug exposure also was taken with special attention on the use of antidepressants , anorexigens , and amphetamines .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Five hundred seventy - nine patients were studied , 205 with PPH and 374 with pulmonary hypertension from other causes ( secondary pulmonary hypertension [ SPH ] ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
However , of the medications surveyed , only the fenfluramines had a significant preferential association with PPH as compared with SPH ( adjusted odds ratio for use > 6 months , 7.5 ; 95% confidence interval , 1.7 to 32.4 ) .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

BACKGROUND : Treatment with angiotensin - converting enzyme ( ACE ) inhibitors reduces mortality and morbidity in patients with chronic heart failure ( CHF ) , but most affected patients are not receiving these agents or are being treated with doses lower than those found to be efficacious in trials , primarily because of concerns about the safety and tolerability of these agents , especially at the recommended doses .

The present study examines the safety and tolerability of high- compared with low - dose lisinopril in CHF .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
The Assessment of Lisinopril and Survival study was a multicenter , randomized , double - blind trial in which patients with or without previous ACE inhibitor treatment were stabilized receiving medium - dose lisinopril ( 12.5 or 15.0 mg once daily [ OD ] ) for 2 to 4 weeks and then randomized to high- ( 35.0 or 32.5 mg OD ) or low - dose ( 5.0 or 2.5 mg OD ) groups .

Patients with New York Heart Association classes II to IV CHF and left ventricular ejection fractions of no greater than 0.30 ( n = 3164 ) were randomized and followed up for a median of 46 months .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We examined the occurrence of adverse events and the need for discontinuation and dose reduction during treatment , with a focus on hypotension and renal dysfunction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
Of 405 patients not previously receiving an ACE inhibitor , doses in only 4.2% could not be titrated to the medium doses required for randomization because of symptoms possibly related to hypotension ( 2.0% ) or because of renal dysfunction or hyperkalemia ( 2.3% ) .

Simultaneous abuse of cocaine and ethanol affects 12 million Americans annually .	O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
Their combined cardiac toxicity may be due to independent effects of each drug ; however , they may also be due to cocaethylene ( CE ) , a cocaine metabolite formed only in the presence of ethanol .

OBJECTIVE : Myeloperoxidase antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody ( MPO - ANCA)-positive vasculitis has been reported in patients with Graves ' disease who were treated with propylthiouracil ( PTU ) .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
The appearance of MPO - ANCA in these cases was suspected of being related to PTU because the titres of MPO - ANCA decreased when PTU was stopped .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Nevertheless , there have been no studies on the temporal relationship between the appearance of MPO - ANCA and vasculitis during PTU therapy , or on the incidence of MPO - ANCA in untreated Graves ' disease patients .

Therefore , we sought to address these parameters in patients with Graves ' disease .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
We investigated 102 untreated patients with hyperthyroidism due to Graves ' disease for the presence of MPO - ANCA , and for the development vasculitis after starting PTU therapy .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Twenty - nine of them were later excluded because of adverse effects of PTU or because the observation period was less than 3 months .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Before treatment , the MPO - ANCA titres of all 102 untreated Graves ' disease patients were within the reference range ( below 10 U / ml ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Three ( 4.1% ) of the 73 patients were positive for MPO - ANCA at 13 , 16 and 17 months , respectively , after the start of PTU therapy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In two of them , the MPO - ANCA titres transiently increased to 12.8 and 15.0 U / ml , respectively , despite continued PTU therapy , but no vasculitic disorders developed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O
In the third patient , the MPO - ANCA titre increased to 204 U / ml and she developed a higher fever , oral ulcers and polyarthralgia , but the symptoms resolved 2 weeks after stopping PTU therapy , and the MPO - ANCA titre decreased to 20.7	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O

This study examined the role of phase 2 early afterdepolarization ( EAD ) in producing a trigger to initiate torsade de pointes ( TdP ) with QT prolongation induced by dl - sotalol and azimilide .

The contribution of transmural dispersion of repolarization ( TDR ) to transmural propagation of EAD and the maintenance of TdP was also evaluated .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
- Sotalol preferentially prolonged action potential duration ( APD ) in M cells dose - dependently ( 1 to 100 micromol / L ) , leading to QT prolongation and an increase in TDR .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
Azimilide , however , significantly prolonged APD and QT interval at concentrations from 0.1 to 10	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Unlike dl - sotalol , azimilide ( > 3 micromol / L ) increased epicardial APD markedly , causing a diminished TDR .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Although both dl - sotalol and azimilide rarely induced EADs in canine left ventricles , they produced frequent EADs in rabbits , in which more pronounced QT prolongation was seen .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
An increase in TDR by dl - sotalol facilitated transmural propagation of EADs that initiated multiple episodes of spontaneous TdP in 3 of 6 rabbit left ventricles .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Of note , although azimilide ( 3 to 10 micromol / L ) increased APD more than dl - sotalol , its EADs often failed to propagate transmurally , probably because of a diminished TDR .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This study provides the first direct evidence from intracellular action potential recordings that phase 2 EAD can be generated from intact ventricular wall and produce a trigger to initiate the onset of TdP under QT prolongation .

The present study describes the delayed development of a severe bladder pathology in a susceptible strain of mice ( DBA/2 ) but not in a resistant strain ( C57BL/6 ) when both were treated with a single 300 mg / kg dose of cyclophosphamide ( CY ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
Inbred DBA/2 and C57BL/6 female mice were injected with CY , and the effect of the drug on the bladder was assessed during 100 days by light microscopy using different staining procedures , and after 30 days by conventional electron microscopy .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Early CY toxicity caused a typical haemorrhagic cystitis in both strains that was completely repaired in about 7 - 10 days .	O I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After 30 days of CY injection ulcerous and non - ulcerous forms of chronic cystitis appeared in 86% of DBA/2 mice but only in 4% of C57BL/6 mice .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Delayed cystitis was characterized by infiltration and transepithelial passage into the lumen of inflammatory cells and by frequent exfoliation of the urothelium .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Carvedilol protects against doxorubicin - induced mitochondrial cardiomyopathy .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
Several cytopathic mechanisms have been suggested to mediate the dose - limiting cumulative and irreversible cardiomyopathy caused by doxorubicin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
Recent evidence indicates that oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are key factors in the pathogenic process .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The objective of this investigation was to test the hypothesis that carvedilol , a nonselective beta - adrenergic receptor antagonist with potent antioxidant properties , protects against the cardiac and hepatic mitochondrial bioenergetic dysfunction associated with subchronic doxorubicin toxicity .

The hyperventilation maneuver caused a decrease in spontaneous ventilation in pilocarpine - treated and control rats .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Although VE had a similar decrease in both groups , in the epileptic group , the decrease in VE was due to a significant ( p < 0.05 ) increase in TE peak in relation to that of the control animals .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Current options of treatment include oral anticholinergic drugs , the topical application of anticholinergics or aluminum chloride , and the injection of botulinum toxin .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Thirteen patients have been treated to date with 1.5% or 2% topical glycopyrrolate .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
All patients had gustatory hyperhidrosis , which interfered with their social activities , after transthroacic endoscopic sympathectomy , and which was associated with compensatory focal hyperhidrosis .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
After applying topical glycopyrrolate , the subjective effect was excellent ( no sweating after eating hot spicy food ) in 10 patients ( 77% ) , and fair ( clearly reduced sweating ) in 3 patients ( 23% ) .

Pharmacological characteristics and side effects of a new galenic formulation of propofol without soyabean oil .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
We compared the pharmacokinetics , pharmacodynamics and safety profile of a new galenic formulation of propofol ( AM149 1% ) , which does not contain soyabean oil , with a standard formulation of propofol ( Disoprivan 1% ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O
In a randomised , double - blind , cross - over study , 30 healthy volunteers received a single intravenous bolus injection of 2.5 mg.kg-1 propofol .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Plasma propofol levels were measured for 48 h following drug administration and evaluated according to a three - compartment model .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The pharmacodynamic parameters assessed included induction and emergence times , respiratory and cardiovascular effects , and pain on injection .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Owing to a high incidence of thrombophlebitis , the study was terminated prematurely and only the data of the two parallel treatment groups ( 15 patients in each group ) were analysed .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Pain on injection ( 80 vs. 20% , p < 0.01 ) and thrombophlebitis ( 93.3 vs. 6.6% , p	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O

Although both formulations had similar pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles the new formulation is not suitable for clinical use due to the high incidence of thrombophlebitis produced .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Vinorelbine - related cardiac events : a meta - analysis of randomized clinical trials .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Several cases of cardiac adverse reactions related to vinorelbine ( VNR ) have been reported in the literature .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
In order to quantify the incidence of these cardiac events , we performed a meta - analysis of clinical trials comparing VNR with other chemotherapeutic agents in the treatment of various malignancies .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Randomized clinical trials comparing VNR with other drugs in the treatment of cancer were searched in Medline , Embase , Evidence - based Medicine Reviews databases and the Cochrane library from 1987 to 2002 .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We found 19 trials , involving 2441 patients treated by VNR and 2050 control patients .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
The incidence of cardiac events with VNR was 1.19% [ 95% confidence interval ( CI ) ( 0.75 ; 1.67 ) ] .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
There was no difference in the risk of cardiac events between VNR and other drugs [ odds ratio : 0.92 , 95% CI ( 0.54 ; 1.55 ) ] .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The risk of VNR cardiac events was similar to vindesine ( VDS ) and other cardiotoxic drugs [ fluorouracil , anthracyclines , gemcitabine ( GEM ) em leader ] .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
Even if it did not reach statistical significance because of a few number of cases , the risk was lower in trials excluding patients with cardiac history , and seemed to be higher in trials including patients with pre - existing cardiac diseases .

All patients taking Vigabatrin alone or in combination with other antiepileptic drugs for at least 5 years ( range 5 - 12 years ) were entered into a visual surveillance programme .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Following already published methodology ( Eye 2002 ; 16;567 - 571 ) monocular mean radial degrees ( MRDs ) to the I/4e isopter on Goldmann perimetry was calculated for the right eye at the time of discovery of a visual field defect and again after not less than 18 months follow - up .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Only one patient demonstrated a deterioration in visual field during the study period and discontinued treatment .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Established visual field defects presumed to be due to Vigabatrin therapy did not usually progress in spite of continuing use of the medication .	O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These data give support to the hypothesis that the pathogenesis of Vigabatrin - associated visual field defects may be an idiosyncratic adverse drug reaction rather than dose - dependent toxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Induction of rosaceiform dermatitis during treatment of facial inflammatory dermatoses with tacrolimus ointment .	O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O
Tacrolimus ointment is increasingly used for anti - inflammatory treatment of sensitive areas such as the face , and recent observations indicate that the treatment is effective in steroid - aggravated rosacea and perioral dermatitis .

We report on rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Six adult patients with inflammatory facial dermatoses were treated with tacrolimus ointment because of the ineffectiveness of standard treatments .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Within 2 to 3 weeks of initially effective and well - tolerated treatment , 3 patients with a history of rosacea and 1 with a history of acne experienced sudden worsening with pustular rosaceiform lesions .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
In 1 patient with eyelid eczema , rosaceiform periocular dermatitis gradually appeared after 3 weeks of treatment .	O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
In 1 patient with atopic dermatitis , telangiectatic and papular rosacea insidiously appeared after 5 months of treatment .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Our observations suggest that the spectrum of rosaceiform dermatitis as a complication of treatment with tacrolimus ointment is heterogeneous .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
A variety of factors , such as vasoactive properties of tacrolimus , proliferation of Demodex due to local immunosuppression , and the occlusive properties of the ointment , may be involved in the observed phenomena .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Structural abnormalities in the brains of human subjects who use methamphetamine .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

Studies of human subjects who have used MA chronically have revealed deficits in dopaminergic and serotonergic systems and cerebral metabolic abnormalities .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Using magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) and new computational brain - mapping techniques , we determined the pattern of structural brain alterations associated with chronic MA abuse in human subjects and related these deficits to cognitive impairment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
We used high - resolution MRI and surface - based computational image analyses to map regional abnormalities in the cortex , hippocampus , white matter , and ventricles in 22 human subjects who used MA and 21 age - matched , healthy controls .

Cortical maps revealed severe gray - matter deficits in the cingulate , limbic , and paralimbic cortices of MA abusers ( averaging 11.3% below control ;	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
On average , MA abusers had 7.8% smaller hippocampal volumes than control subjects ( p < 0.01 ; left , p = 0.01 ; right , p < 0.05 ) and significant white - matter hypertrophy ( 7.0% ;	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
MRI - based maps suggest that chronic methamphetamine abuse causes a selective pattern of cerebral deterioration that contributes to impaired memory performance .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
MA may selectively damage the medial temporal lobe and , consistent with metabolic studies , the cingulate - limbic cortex , inducing neuroadaptation , neuropil reduction , or cell death .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Prominent white - matter hypertrophy may result from altered myelination and adaptive glial changes , including gliosis secondary to neuronal damage .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
These brain substrates may help account for the symptoms of MA abuse , providing therapeutic targets for drug - induced brain injury .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Disruption of hepatic lipid homeostasis in mice after amiodarone treatment is associated with peroxisome proliferator - activated receptor - alpha target gene activation .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Amiodarone , an efficacious and widely used antiarrhythmic agent , has been reported to cause hepatotoxicity in some patients .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
To gain insight into the mechanism of this unwanted effect , mice were administered various doses of amiodarone and examined for changes in hepatic histology and gene regulation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Amiodarone induced hepatomegaly , hepatocyte microvesicular lipid accumulation , and a significant decrease in serum triglycerides and glucose .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
Northern blot analysis of hepatic RNA revealed a dose - dependent increase in the expression of a number of genes critical for fatty acid oxidation , lipoprotein assembly , and lipid transport .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
The absence of induction of these genes as well as hepatomegaly in PPARalpha knockout [ PPARalpha-/- ] mice indicated that the effects of amiodarone were dependent upon the presence of a functional PPARalpha gene .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Compared to wild - type mice , treatment of PPARalpha-/- mice with amiodarone resulted in an increased rate and extent of total body weight loss .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
The inability of amiodarone to directly activate either human or mouse PPARalpha transiently expressed in human HepG2 hepatoma cells indicates that the effects of amiodarone on the function of this receptor were indirect .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Based upon these results , we conclude that amiodarone disrupts hepatic lipid homeostasis and that the increased expression of PPARalpha target genes is secondary to this toxic effect .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results provide important new mechanistic information regarding the hepatotoxic effects of amiodarone and indicate that PPARalpha protects against amiodarone - induced hepatotoxicity .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O

OBJECTIVES : To evaluate the effect of trazodone treatment on behaviors dependent on the functional status of the nigrostriatal DAergic system .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The effect of pretreatment with trazodone on dexamphetamine- and apomorphine - induced oral stereotypies , on catalepsy induced by haloperidol and apomorphine ( 0.05 mg / kg , i.p . ) , on ergometrine - induced wet dog shake ( WDS ) behavior and fluoxetine - induced penile erections was studied in rats .

Our results indicate that trazodone at 2.5 - 20 mg / kg does not block pre- and postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors , while at 30 , 40 and 50 mg / kg it blocks postsynaptic striatal D2 DA receptors .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

We suggest that trazodone ( 5 , 10 and 20 mg / kg ) , by blocking the 5-HT 2C receptors , releases the nigrostriatal DAergic neurons from tonic inhibition caused by 5-HT , and thereby potentiates dexamphetamine stereotypy and antagonizes haloperidol catalepsy .

BACKGROUND : Acetaminophen ( paracetamol -- P ) and Nimesulide ( N ) are widely used analgesic - antipyretic / anti - inflammatory drugs .	O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The rate of adverse hypersensitivity reactions to these agents is generally low .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Celecoxib ( CE ) is a novel drug , with high selectivity and affinity for COX-2 enzyme .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We evaluated the tolerability of CE in a group of patients with documented history of adverse cutaneous reactions to P and N associated or not to classic NSAIDs .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O
: We studied 9 patients with hypersensitivity to P and N with or without associated reactions to classic NSAIDs .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
The diagnosis of P and N - induced skin reactions was based in vivo challenge .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
After three days , a cumulative dosage of 200 mg of CE in refracted doses were given .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
The challenge was considered positive if one or more of the following appeared : erythema , rush or urticaria - angioedema .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
No reaction was observed with placebo and eight patients ( 88.8% ) tolerated CE .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

Case - control study of regular analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory use and end - stage renal disease .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Studies on the association between the long - term use of aspirin and other analgesic and nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drugs ( NSAIDs ) and end - stage renal disease ( ESRD ) have given conflicting results .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O
In order to examine this association , a case - control study with incident cases of ESRD was carried out .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
METHODS : The cases were all patients entering the local dialysis program because of ESRD in the study area between June 1 , 1995 and November 30 , 1997 .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
They were classified according to the underlying disease , which had presumably led them to ESRD .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
For specific groups of drugs , the risks were 1.56 ( 1.05 - 2.30 ) for aspirin , 1.03 ( 0.60 - 1.76 )	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
for pyrazolones , 0.80 ( 0.39 - 1.63 ) for paracetamol , and 0.94 ( 0.57 - 1.56 ) for nonaspirin NSAIDs .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
The risk of ESRD associated with aspirin was related to the cumulated dose and duration of use , and it was particularly high among the subset of patients with vascular nephropathy as underlying disease [ 2.35 ( 1.17 - 4.72 ) ] .	O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
CONCLUSION : Our data indicate that long - term use of nonaspirin analgesic drugs and NSAIDs is not associated with an increased risk of ESRD .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
However , the chronic use of aspirin may increase the risk of ESRD .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O

RESULTS : Densitometry showed no significant difference regarding GAP43-ir in the IML between Pilo , CHX+Pilo , and control groups .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
However , the results of the width of the GAP43-ir band in the IML showed that CHX+Pilo and control animals had a significantly larger band ( p = 0.03 ) as compared with that in the Pilo group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Our current finding that animals in the CHX+Pilo group have a GAP43-ir band in the IML , similar to that of controls , reinforces prior data on the blockade of MFS in these animals .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The change in GAP43-ir present in Pilo - treated animals was a thinning of the band to a very narrow layer just above the granule cell layer that is likely to be associated with the loss of hilar cell projections that express GAP-43 .

Nicotine ( 0.05 - 0.25 mg / kg ) itself did not produce any significant effect in the EPM test , whereas caffeine ( 70 mg / kg ) and pentylenetetrazole ( 30 mg / kg ) produced an anxiogenic effect , apparent with decreases in open - arm time and entry .

Long - term oestrogen - only HT also significantly increased the risk of stroke and gallbladder disease .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O
Overall , the only statistically significant benefits of HT were a decreased incidence of fractures and colon cancer with long - term use .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
Among relatively healthy women over 65 years taking continuous combined HT , there was a statistically significant increase in the incidence of dementia .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Among women with cardiovascular disease , long - term use of combined continuous HT significantly increased the risk of venous thromboembolism .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
However , one trial analysed subgroups of 2839 relatively healthy 50 to 59 year - old women taking combined continuous HT and 1637 taking oestrogen - only HT , versus similar - sized placebo groups .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O

The aims of this study were to examine vancomycin ( VCM)-induced oxidative stress that promotes production of reactive oxygen species ( ROS ) and to investigate the role of erdosteine , an expectorant agent , which has also antioxidant properties , on kidney tissue against the possible VCM - induced renal impairment in rats .

Does domperidone potentiate mirtazapine - associated restless legs syndrome ?	O I-Entity O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
There is now evidence to suggest a central role for the dopaminergic system in restless legs syndrome ( RLS ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O
For example , the symptoms of RLS can be dramatically improved by levodopa and dopamine agonists , whereas central dopamine D2 receptor antagonists can induce or aggravate RLS symptoms .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
To our knowledge , there is no previous report regarding whether domperidone , a peripheral dopamine D2 receptor antagonist , can also induce or aggravate symptoms of RLS .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Mirtazapine , the first noradrenergic and specific serotonergic antidepressant ( NaSSA ) , has been associated with RLS in several recent publications .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O
The authors report here a depressed patient comorbid with postprandial dyspepsia who developed RLS after mirtazapine had been added to his domperidone therapy .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O
Our patient started to have symptoms of RLS only after he had been treated with mirtazapine , and his RLS symptoms resolved completely upon discontinuation of his mirtazapine .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Such a temporal relationship between the use of mirtazapine and the symptoms of RLS in our patient did not support a potentiating effect of domperione on mirtazapine - associated RLS .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O

5-Fluorouracil cardiotoxicity induced by alpha - fluoro - beta - alanine .	I-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Cardiotoxicity is a rare complication occurring during 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) treatment for malignancies .	I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O
We herein report the case of a 70-year - old man with 5-FU - induced cardiotoxicity , in whom a high serum level of alpha - fluoro - beta - alanine ( FBAL ) was observed .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O
The patient , who had unresectable colon cancer metastases to the liver and lung , was referred to us for chemotherapy from an affiliated hospital ; he had no cardiac history .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
After admission , the patient received a continuous intravenous infusion of 5-FU ( 1000 mg / day ) , during which precordial pain with right bundle branch block occurred concomitantly with a high serum FBAL concentration of 1955 ng / ml .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Both the precordial pain and the electrocardiographic changes disappeared spontaneously after the discontinuation of 5-FU .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
As the precordial pain in this patient was considered to have been due to 5-FU - induced cardiotoxicity , the administration of 5-FU was abandoned .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O
Instead , oral administration of S-1 ( a derivative of 5-FU ) , at 200 mg / day twice a week , was instituted , because S-1 has a strong inhibitory effect on dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase , which catalyzes the degradative of 5-FU into FBAL .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
The serum FBAL concentration subsequently decreased to 352 ng / ml , the same as the value measured on the first day of S-1 administration .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thereafter , no cardiac symptoms were observed .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O
The experience of this case , together with a review of the literature , suggests that FBAL is related to 5-FU - induced cardiotoxicity .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O

The influence of the time interval between monoHER and doxorubicin administration on the protection against doxorubicin - induced cardiotoxicity in mice .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Despite its well - known cardiotoxicity , the anthracyclin doxorubicin ( DOX ) continues to be an effective and widely used chemotherapeutic agent .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
DOX - induced cardiac damage presumably results from the formation of free radicals by DOX .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Reactive oxygen species particularly affect the cardiac myocytes because these cells seem to have a relatively poor antioxidant defense system .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The semisynthetic flavonoid monohydroxyethylrutoside ( monoHER ) showed cardioprotection against DOX - induced cardiotoxicity through its radical scavenging and iron chelating properties .	O O I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O
Because of the relatively short final half - life of monoHER ( about 30 min ) , it is expected that the time interval between monoHER and DOX might be of influence on the cardioprotective effect of monoHER .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Six groups of 6 BALB / c mice were treated with saline , DOX alone or DOX ( 4 mg / kg i.v . )	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
preceded by monoHER ( 500 mg / kg i.p . ) with an interval of 10 , 30 , 60 or 120 min .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Their cardiac tissues were processed for light microscopy , after which cardiomyocyte damage was evaluated according to Billingham ( in Cancer Treat Rep 62(6):865 - 872 , 1978 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Microscopic evaluation revealed that treatment with DOX alone induced significant cardiac damage in comparison to the saline control group ( P<0.001 ) .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The number of damaged cardiomyocytes was 9.6-fold ( 95% CI 4.4 - 21.0 ) higher in mice treated with DOX alone than that in animals of the control group .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The ratio of aberrant cardiomyocytes in mice treated with DOX preceded by monoHER and those in mice treated with saline ranged from 1.6 to 2.8 ( mean 2.2 , 95% CI 1.2 - 4.1 , P=0.019 ) .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The mean protective effect by adding monoHER before DOX led to a significant 4.4-fold reduction ( P<0.001 , 95% CI 2.3 - 8.2 ) of abnormal cardiomyocytes .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This protective effect did not depend on the time interval between monoHER and DOX administration ( P=0.345 ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O
CONCLUSION : The results indicate that in an outpatient clinical setting monoHER may be administered shortly before DOX .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O

LV hypertrophy induced by Iso treatment was significantly higher in TGR than in SD rats ( in g LV wt/100	B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The greater LV hypertrophy in TGR rats was associated with more pronounced downregulation of beta - AR and upregulation of LV beta - AR kinase-1 mRNA levels compared with those in SD rats .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The decrease in the heart rate ( HR ) induced by the beta - AR antagonist metoprolol in conscious rats was significantly attenuated in TGR compared with SD rats ( -9.9	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Mechanisms of hypertension induced by nitric oxide ( NO ) deficiency : focus on venous function .	O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Loss of endothelial cell - derived nitric oxide ( NO ) in hypertension is a hallmark of arterial dysfunction .	O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Experimental hypertension created by the removal of NO , however , involves mechanisms in addition to decreased arterial vasodilator activity .	O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
We hypothesized that increased venous smooth muscle ( venomotor ) tone plays a role in Nomega - nitro - L - arginine ( LNNA ) hypertension through these mechanisms .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O

Association of DRD2 polymorphisms and chlorpromazine - induced extrapyramidal syndrome in Chinese schizophrenic patients .	O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
Extrapyramidal syndrome ( EPS ) is most commonly affected by typical antipsychotic drugs that have a high affinity with the D2 receptor .	B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Recently , many research groups have reported on the positive relationship between the genetic variations in the DRD2 gene and the therapeutic response in schizophrenia patients as a result of the role of variations in the receptor in modulating receptor expression .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this study , we evaluate the role DRD2 plays in chlorpromazine - induced EPS in schizophrenic patients .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
: We identified seven SNP(single nucleotide polymorphism ) ( -141Cins > del , TaqIB , TaqID , Ser311Cys , rs6275 , rs6277 and TaqIA ) in the DRD2 gene in 146 schizophrenic inpatients ( 59 with EPS and 87 without EPS according to the Simpson - Angus Scale ) treated with chlorpromazine after 8 weeks .

Physical training decreases susceptibility to subsequent pilocarpine - induced seizures in the rat .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O
Regular motor activity has many benefits for mental and physical condition but its implications for epilepsy are still controversial .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
In order to elucidate this problem , we have studied the effect of long - term physical activity on susceptibility to subsequent seizures .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Thereafter , seizures were induced by pilocarpine injections in trained and non - trained control groups .	O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
During the acute period of status epilepticus , we measured : ( 1 ) the latency of the first motor sign , ( 2 ) the intensity of seizures , ( 3 ) the time when it occurred within the 6-h observation period , and ( 4 ) the time when the acute period ended .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
All these behavioral parameters showed statistically significant changes suggesting that regular physical exercises decrease susceptibility to subsequently induced seizures and ameliorate the course of experimentally induced status epilepticus .

Tonic dopaminergic stimulation impairs associative learning in healthy subjects .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Endogenous dopamine plays a central role in salience coding during associative learning .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Administration of the dopamine precursor levodopa enhances learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Because levodopa increases both phasic and tonic dopaminergic neurotransmission , the critical mechanism mediating the enhancement of learning is unresolved .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Subjects received the tonically stimulating dopamine - receptor agonist pergolide ( 0.1 mg ) vs placebo 120 min before training on each training day .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The dopamine agonist significantly impaired novel word learning compared to placebo .	O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O
Subjects treated with pergolide also showed restricted emotional responses compared to the PLACEBO group .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The extent of ' flattened ' affect with pergolide was related to the degree of learning inhibition .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that tonic occupation of dopamine receptors impairs learning by competition with phasic dopamine signals .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Thus , phasic signaling seems to be the critical mechanism by which dopamine enhances associative learning in healthy subjects and stroke patients .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O

This study was undertaken to evaluate the outcomes of liver transplantation for patients with hepatitis B virus ( HBV ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
A retrospective chart analysis and a review of the organ transplant database identified 51 patients ( 43 men and 8 women ) transplanted for benign HBV - related cirrhotic diseases between June 2002 and December 2004 who had survived more than 3 months .

We have studied the effects of oral treatment with eslicarbazepine acetate on a whole - animal model in which partial seizures can be elicited repeatedly on different days without changes in threshold or seizure patterns .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
In the animals treated with threshold doses of picrotoxin , the average number of seizures was 2.3+/-1.2 , and average seizure duration was 39.5+/-8.4s .	O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Pre - treatment with a dose of 30 mg / kg 2h before picrotoxin microperfusion prevented seizures in the 75% of the rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Lower doses ( 3 and 10mg / kg ) did not suppress seizures , however , after administration of 10mg /	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Nephropathy caused by Chinese herbs has previously been reported , usually involving the use of aristolochic acids .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
We report a 23-year - old woman who developed acute renal failure following prolonged use of a proprietary Chinese herbal slimming pill that contained anthraquinone derivatives , extracted from Rhizoma Rhei ( rhubarb ) .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The renal injury was probably aggravated by the concomitant intake of a non - steroidal anti - inflammatory drug , diclofenac .	O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

In this work the effect of CAA on human proximal tubule cells in primary culture ( hRPTEC ) was investigated .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Toxicity of CAA was determined by protein content , cell number , LDH release , trypan blue exclusion assay and caspase-3 activity .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O
Free thiols were measured by the method of Ellman .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
CAA reduced hRPTEC cell number and protein , induced a loss in free intracellular thiols and an increase in necrosis markers .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O
CAA but not acrolein inhibited the cysteine	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity

In cells stained with fluorescent dyes targeting lysosomes , CAA induced an increase in lysosomal size and lysosomal leakage .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
The effects of CAA on cysteine protease activities and thiols could be reproduced in cell lysate .	O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
Acidification , which slowed the reaction of CAA with thiol donors , could also attenuate effects of CAA on necrosis markers , thiol depletion and cysteine protease inhibition in living cells .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O
Thus , CAA directly reacts with cellular protein and non - protein thiols , mediating its toxicity on hRPTEC .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O

Following status epilepticus in the rat , dentate granule cell neurogenesis increases greatly , and many of the new neurons appear to develop ectopically , in the hilar region of the hippocampal formation .	O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
It has been suggested that the ectopic hilar granule cells could contribute to the spontaneous seizures that ultimately develop after status epilepticus .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
To quantify this population , the total number of ectopic hilar granule cells was estimated using unbiased stereology at different times after pilocarpine - induced status epilepticus .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
The results indicate that the size of the hilar ectopic granule cell population after status epilepticus is substantial , and stable over time .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Interestingly , the size of the population appears to be correlated with the frequency of behavioral seizures , because animals with more ectopic granule cells in the hilus have more frequent behavioral seizures .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The results provide new insight into the potential role of ectopic hilar granule cells in the pilocarpine model of temporal lobe epilepsy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O

Succimer chelation improves learning , attention , and arousal regulation in lead - exposed rats but produces lasting cognitive impairment in the absence of lead exposure .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O
BACKGROUND : There is growing pressure for clinicians to prescribe chelation therapy at only slightly elevated blood lead levels .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
However , very few studies have evaluated whether chelation improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children , or whether these agents have adverse effects that may affect brain development in the absence of Pb exposure .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
The present study was designed to answer these questions , using a rodent model of early childhood Pb exposure and treatment with succimer , a widely used chelating agent for the treatment of Pb poisoning .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Pb exposure produced lasting impairments in learning , attention , inhibitory control , and arousal regulation , paralleling the areas of dysfunction seen in Pb - exposed children .	I-Entity O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Succimer treatment of the Pb - exposed rats significantly improved learning , attention , and arousal regulation , although the efficacy of the treatment varied as a function of the Pb exposure level and the specific functional deficit .	I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
In contrast , succimer treatment of rats not previously exposed to Pb produced lasting and pervasive cognitive and affective dysfunction comparable in magnitude to that produced by the higher Pb exposure regimen .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
These are the first data , to our knowledge , to show that treatment with any chelating agent can alleviate cognitive deficits due to Pb exposure .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
These findings suggest that it may be possible to identify a succimer treatment protocol that improves cognitive outcomes in Pb - exposed children .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
However , they also suggest that succimer treatment should be strongly discouraged for children who do not have elevated tissue levels of Pb or other heavy metals .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O

Twelve patients ( 43% ) were found to have intraoperative ipsilateral vocal cord paralysis .	O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
There were no significant differences in operating time or volume or frequency of anesthetic administration in patients with temporary vocal cord paralysis compared with those without .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O

There was a marked increase in the number of TUNEL positive cells and nestin positive cells in BCNU - exposed group , but a decreased immunoreactivity to glial fibrillary acidic protein , synaptophysin and transforming growth factor beta1 was observed , indicating a delayed maturation , and melatonin significantly reversed these changes .

Lamivudine is used for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B patients .	I-Entity O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O
Recent studies show that the YMDD motif mutants ( resistant hepatitis B virus ) occur as natural genome variability in lamivudine - untreated chronic hepatitis B patients .	O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O
In this study we aimed to determine the rate of YMDD motif mutants in lamivudine - untreated chronic hepatitis B patients in Iran .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O
A total of 77 chronic hepatitis B patients who had not been treated with lamivudine were included in the study .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
All patients were also tested for liver enzymes , anti - HCV , HBeAg , and anti - HBe .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
HBeAg was positive in 40% and anti - HBe in 60% of the patients .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O

The differential effects of bupivacaine and lidocaine on prostaglandin E2 release , cyclooxygenase gene expression and pain in a clinical pain model .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O
In addition to blocking nociceptive input from surgical sites , long - acting local anesthetics might directly modulate inflammation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
In the present study , we describe the proinflammatory effects of bupivacaine on local prostaglandin E2 ( PGE2 ) production and cyclooxygenase ( COX ) gene expression that increases postoperative pain in human subjects .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O
METHODS : Subjects ( n = 114 ) undergoing extraction of impacted third molars received either 2% lidocaine or 0.5% bupivacaine before surgery and either rofecoxib 50 mg or placebo orally 90 min before surgery and for the following 48 h. Oral mucosal biopsies were taken before surgery and 48 h after surgery .

After extraction , a microdialysis probe was placed at the surgical site for PGE2 and thromboxane B2 ( TXB2 ) measurements .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O
The bupivacaine / rofecoxib group reported significantly less pain , as assessed by a visual analog scale , compared with the other three treatment groups over the first 4 h.	O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
However , the bupivacaine / placebo group reported significantly more pain at 24 h and PGE2 levels during the first 4 h were significantly higher than the other three treatment groups .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Moreover , bupivacaine significantly increased COX-2 gene expression at 48 h as compared with the lidocaine / placebo group .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
Thromboxane levels were not significantly affected by any of the treatments , indicating that the effects seen were attributable to inhibition of COX-2 , but not COX-1 .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These results suggest that bupivacaine stimulates COX-2 gene expression after tissue injury , which is associated with higher PGE2 production and pain after the local anesthetic effect dissipates .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Previous studies have examined the expression and regulation of tyrosine kinase receptors ( Trks ) in micturition reflexes with urinary bladder inflammation .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
The present studies examine the expression and regulation of another receptor known to bind NGF , p75(NTR ) , after various durations of bladder inflammation induced by cyclophosphamide ( CYP ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
CYP - induced cystitis increased ( P < or = 0.001 )	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The number of p75(NTR)-immunoreactive ( -IR ) cells in the lumbosacral dorsal root ganglia ( DRG ) also increased ( P < or = 0.05 ) with CYP - induced cystitis ( acute , intermediate , and chronic ) .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Quantitative , real - time polymerase chain reaction also demonstrated significant increases ( P < or = 0.01 ) in p75(NTR ) mRNA in DRG with intermediate and chronic CYP - induced cystitis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
In bladder afferent cells in DRG , p75(NTR)-IR was also increased ( P < or = 0.01 ) with cystitis .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
These studies demonstrate that p75(NTR ) expression in micturition reflexes is present constitutively and modified by bladder inflammation .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Azathioprine - induced suicidal erythrocyte death .	I-Entity O O O O O O
Azathioprine is widely used as an immunosuppressive drug .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The side effects of azathioprine include anemia , which has been attributed to bone marrow suppression .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
Alternatively , anemia could result from accelerated suicidal erythrocyte death or eryptosis , which is characterized by exposure of phosphatidylserine ( PS ) at the erythrocyte surface and by cell shrinkage .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
METHODS : The present experiments explored whether azathioprine influences eryptosis .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O
According to annexin V binding , erythrocytes from patients indeed showed a significant increase of PS exposure within 1 week of treatment with azathioprine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
In a second series , cytosolic Ca2 + activity ( Fluo3 fluorescence ) , cell volume ( forward scatter ) , and PS - exposure ( annexin V binding ) were determined by FACS analysis in erythrocytes from healthy volunteers .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Exposure to azathioprine ( > or = 2 microg / mL ) for 48 hours increased cytosolic Ca2 + activity and annexin V binding and decreased forward scatter .	O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The effect of azathioprine on both annexin V binding and forward scatter was significantly blunted in the nominal absence of extracellular Ca2 + .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O

Thalidomide and sensory neurotoxicity : a neurophysiological study .	I-Entity O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
Recent studies confirmed a high incidence of sensory axonal neuropathy in patients treated with different doses of thalidomide .	O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
The study 's aims were to measure variations in sural nerve sensory action potential ( SAP ) amplitude in patients with refractory cutaneous lupus erythematosus ( CLE ) treated with thalidomide and use these findings to identify the neurotoxic potential of thalidomide and the recovery capacity of sensory fibres after discontinuation of treatment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Clinical and electrophysiological data in 12 female patients with CLE during treatment with thalidomide and up to 47 months after discontinuation of treatment were analysed .	O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
Five patients complained of paresthesias and leg cramps .	O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
After thalidomide treatment , sural SAP amplitude recovered in 3 patients .	O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O
At detection of reduction in sural nerve SAP amplitude , the median thalidomide cumulative dose was 21.4 g. The threshold neurotoxic dosage is lower than previously reported .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O

Amiodarone - related pulmonary mass and unique membranous glomerulonephritis in a patient with valvular heart disease : Diagnostic pitfall and new findings .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
Amiodarone is an anti - arrhythmic drug for life - threatening tachycardia , but various adverse effects have been reported .	I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
Reported herein is an autopsy case of valvular heart disease , in a patient who developed a lung mass ( 1.5 cm in diameter ) and proteinuria ( 2.76 g / day ) after treatment with amiodarone for a long time .

METHODS : In type 2 diabetic patients , cases who developed CAD were compared retrospectively with controls that did not .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O
The 20-year risk of CAD at diagnosis of diabetes , using the UKPDS risk engine , was used to match cases with controls .	O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
The 76 cases of CAD were compared with 152 controls .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O
The hazard of developing CAD ( 95% CI ) associated with initial treatment increased by 2.4-fold ( 1.3 - 4.3 , P=0.004 ) with glibenclamide ; 2-fold ( 0.9 - 4.6 , P=0.099 ) with glipizide ; 2.9-fold ( 1.6 - 5.1 , P=0.000 ) with either , and was unchanged with metformin .

The objective of this review is to summarize practical considerations of argatroban therapy in HIT .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O
The US FDA - recommended argatroban dose in HIT is 2 microg / kg / min ( reduced in patients with hepatic impairment and in paediatric patients ) , adjusted to achieve activated partial thromboplastin times ( aPTTs ) 1.5 - 3 times baseline ( not > 100 seconds ) .

METHOD : Case - based observations from a medical intensive care unit ( MICU ) in a tertiary care facility in a 27-year - old female with FHF from acetaminophen and resultant cerebral edema .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Our patient was admitted to the MICU after being found unresponsive with presumed toxicity from acetaminophen which was ingested over a 2-day period .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Binasal visual field defects are not specific to vigabatrin .	B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
This study investigated the visual defects associated with the antiepileptic drug vigabatrin ( VGB ) .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O
Two hundred four people with epilepsy were grouped on the basis of antiepileptic drug therapy ( current , previous , or no exposure to VGB ) .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Groups were matched with respect to age , gender , and seizure frequency .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Bilateral visual field constriction was observed in 59% of patients currently taking VGB , 43% of patients who previously took VGB , and 24% of patients with no exposure to VGB .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O

Smoking of crack cocaine as a risk factor for HIV infection among people who use injection drugs .	O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O
Little is known about the possible role that smoking crack cocaine has on the incidence of HIV infection .	O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Given the increasing use of crack cocaine , we sought to examine whether use of this illicit drug has become a risk factor for HIV infection .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
To determine whether the risk of HIV seroconversion among daily smokers of crack cocaine changed over time , we used Cox proportional hazards regression and divided the study into 3 periods : May 1 , 1996-Nov . 30 , 1999 ( period 1 ) , Dec. 1 , 1999-Nov . 30 , 2002 ( period 2 ) , and Dec. 1 , 2002-Dec . 30 , 2005 ( period 3 ) .

Of these , 137 acquired HIV infection during follow - up .	O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O
The mean proportion of participants who reported daily smoking of crack cocaine increased from 11.6% in period 1 to 39.7% in period 3 .	O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
After adjusting for potential confounders , we found that the risk of HIV seroconversion among participants who were daily smokers of crack cocaine increased over time ( period 1 : hazard ratio [ HR ] 1.03 , 95% confidence interval [ CI ] 0.57 - 1.85 ; period 2 : HR 1.68 , 95%	O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
INTERPRETATION : Smoking of crack cocaine was found to be an independent risk factor for HIV seroconversion among people who were injection drug users .	O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O

Fluoxetine improves the memory deficits caused by the chemotherapy agent 5-fluorouracil .	I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O
Cancer patients who have been treated with systemic adjuvant chemotherapy have described experiencing deteriorations in cognition .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
A widely used chemotherapeutic agent , 5-fluorouracil ( 5-FU ) , readily crosses the blood - brain barrier and so could have a direct effect on brain function .	O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In contrast reports indicate that hippocampal dependent neurogenesis and cognition are enhanced by the SSRI antidepressant Fluoxetine .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O
In this investigation the behavioural effects of chronic ( two week ) treatment with 5-FU and ( three weeks ) with Fluoxetine either separately or in combination with 5-FU were tested on adult Lister hooded rats .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
Behavioural effects were tested using a context dependent conditioned emotional response test ( CER ) which showed that animals treated with 5-FU had a significant reduction in freezing time compared to controls .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
Animals treated only with 5-FU showed significant deficits in their ability to carry out the OLR task but co administration of Fluoxetine improved their performance .	O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O
5-FU chemotherapy caused a significant reduction in the number of proliferating cells in the sub granular zone of the dentate gyrus compared to controls .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
This reduction was eliminated when Fluoxetine was co administered with 5-FU .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O
Fluoxetine on its own had no effect on proliferating cell number or behaviour .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O
These findings suggest that 5-FU can negatively affect both cell proliferation and hippocampal dependent working memory and that these deficits can be reversed by the simultaneous administration of the antidepressant Fluoxetine .

Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia : a practical review .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
Heparin - induced thrombocytopenia ( HIT ) remains under - recognized despite its potentially devastating outcomes .	I-Entity O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
It begins when heparin exposure stimulates the formation of heparin - platelet factor 4 antibodies , which in turn triggers the release of procoagulant platelet particles .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
Thrombosis and thrombocytopenia that follow comprise the 2 hallmark traits of HIT , with the former largely responsible for significant vascular complications .	I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
The prevalence of HIT varies among several subgroups , with greater incidence in surgical as compared with medical populations .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
HIT must be acknowledged for its intense predilection for thrombosis and suspected whenever thrombosis occurs after heparin exposure .	I-Entity O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O
The treatment of HIT mandates an immediate cessation of all heparin exposure and the institution of an antithrombotic therapy , most commonly using a direct thrombin inhibitor .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
"Current """""""" diagnostic """""""" tests , which primarily include functional and antigenic assays , have more of a confirmatory than diagnostic role in the management of HIT ."	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Special attention must be paid to cardiac patients who are often exposed to heparin multiple times during their course of treatment .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

As heparin remains one of the most frequently used medications today with potential for HIT with every heparin exposure , a close vigilance of platelet counts must be practiced whenever heparin is initiated .

For patients with bilateral abductor paralysis , age , sex , paralytic Botox dose , prior Botox dose , and course following paralysis were noted .	O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O O
From a database of 452 patients receiving Botox , 352 patients had been diagnosed with ADSD .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O
Of these 352 patients , eight patients suffered bilateral abductor paralysis , and two suffered this complication twice .	O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O

The incidence of abductor paralysis after Botox injection for ADSD was 0.34% .	O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O
Bilateral abductor paralysis is a rare complication of Botox injections for ADSD , causing difficulty with breathing upon exertion .	O O I-Entity O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O
The likely mechanism of paralysis is diffusion of Botox around the muscular process of the arytenoid to the posterior cricoarytenoid muscles .	O O O O I-Entity O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O

Mitochondrial impairment contributes to cocaine - induced cardiac dysfunction : Prevention by the targeted antioxidant MitoQ.	B-Entity I-Entity O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O I-Entity
The goal of this study was to assess mitochondrial function and ROS production in an experimental model of cocaine - induced cardiac dysfunction .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O
We hypothesized that cocaine abuse may lead to altered mitochondrial function that in turn may cause left ventricular dysfunction .	O O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity I-Entity O
Seven days of cocaine administration to rats led to an increased oxygen consumption detected in cardiac fibers , specifically through complex I and complex III .	O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O
In parallel there was a decrease in ATP synthesis , whereas no difference was observed in subsarcolemmal mitochondria .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O
This uncoupling effect on oxidative phosphorylation was not detectable after short - term exposure to cocaine , suggesting that these mitochondrial abnormalities were a late rather than a primary event in the pathological response to cocaine .

OBJECTIVE : A multicenter , controlled trial showed that early blockade of the renin - angiotensin system in patients with type 1 diabetes and normoalbuminuria did not retard the progression of nephropathy , suggesting that other mechanism(s ) are involved in the pathogenesis of early diabetic nephropathy ( diabetic nephropathy ) .

In the present study , we hypothesized that blocking EndoMT reduces the early development of diabetic nephropathy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O B-Entity I-Entity O
Blocking studies using receptor for AGE siRNA and a specific inhibitor of Smad3 ( SIS3 ) were performed in MMECs and in STZ - induced diabetic nephropathy in Tie2-Cre;Loxp - EGFP mice .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O B-Entity I-Entity O O O O O O

However , a 38% remission rate has been recently reported in refractory MCL treated with temsirolimus , a mTOR inhibitor .	O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O O
Here we had the opportunity to study a case of refractory MCL who had tumor regression two months after temsirolimus treatment , and a progression - free survival of 10 months .	O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O I-Entity O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O
In this case , lymph node biopsies were performed before and six months after temsirolimus therapy .	O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Comparison of the two biopsies showed that temsirolimus inhibited tumor cell proliferation through cell cycle arrest , but did not induce any change in the number of apoptotic tumor cells .	O O O O O O O I-Entity O I-Entity O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O O I-Entity O O
Apart from this cytostatic effect , temsirolimus had an antiangiogenic effect with decrease of tumor microvessel density and of VEGF expression .	O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O I-Entity O O O O O O O
